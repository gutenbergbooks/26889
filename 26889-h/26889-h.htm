<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>A LECTURE OF THENARD&#8217;S</h3>
</div>

<p>The sun was setting over Paris, a blood-red and
violent-looking sun, like the face of a bully
staring in at the window of a vast chill room.</p>
<p>The bank of cloud above the west, corrugated by
the wind, seemed not unlike the lowermost slats of a
Venetian blind; one might have fancied that a great
finger had tilted them up whilst the red, callous, cruel
face took a last peep at the frost-bitten city, the frost-bound
country&mdash;Montmartre and its windows, winking
and bloodshot; Bercy and its barges; Notre Dame, where
icicles, large as carrots, hung from the lips of the gargoyles,
and the Seine clipping the <i>cité</i> and flowing to the
clean but distant sea.</p>
<p>It was the fourth of January and the last day of Félix
Thénard&#8217;s post-graduate course of lectures at the Beaujon
Hospital.</p>
<p>Post-graduate lectures are intended not for students,
using the word in its limited sense, but for fully fledged
men who wish for extra training in some special subject,
and Thénard, the famous neurologist of the Beaujon,
had a class which practically represented the whole continent
of Europe and half the world. Men from Vienna
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
and Madrid, Germany and Japan, London and New York,
crowded the benches of his lecture room. Even the
Republic of Liberia was represented by a large gentleman,
who seemed carved from solid night and polished with
palm oil.</p>
<p>Dr. Paul Quincy Adams, one of the representatives
of America at the lectures of Thénard, was just reaching
the entrance of the Beaujon as the last rays of sunset
were touching the heights of Montmartre and the
first lamps of Paris were springing alight.</p>
<p>He had walked all the way from his rooms in the
Rue Dijon, for omnibuses were slow and uncomfortable,
cabs were dear, and money was, just at present,
the most unpleasant thing that money can convert itself
into&mdash;an object.</p>
<p>Adams was six feet two, a Vermonter, an American
gentleman whose chest measurements were big, almost,
as his instincts were fine. He had fought his way up,
literally from the soil, putting in terms as seaside <i>café</i>
waiter to help to pay his college fees; putting aside everything
but honour in his grand struggle to freedom and
individual existence, and finishing his college career
with a travelling scholarship which brought him to Paris.</p>
<p>Individualism, the thing that lends something of
greatness to each American, but which does not tend to
the greatness of the nation, was the mainspring of this
big man whom Nature had undoubtedly designed with her
eye on the vast plains, virgin forests, and unfordable
rivers, and across whose shoulder one half divined the
invisible axe of the pioneer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span></p>
<p>He was just twenty-three years of age, yet he looked
thirty: plain enough as far as features go, his face was a
face to remember in time of trouble. It was of the
American type that approximates to the Red Indian,
and you guessed the power that lay behind it by the set
of the cheek-bones, the breadth of the chin and the restfulness
of the eyes. Like the Red Indian, Paul Quincy
Adams was slow of speech. A silent man with his
tongue.</p>
<p>He entered the hospital and passed down a long corridor
to the cloakroom, where he left his overcoat and
from there, by another corridor, he found his way to the
swing-door of the lecture theatre. It wanted five minutes
to the hour. He peeped over the muffing of the glass;
the place was nearly full, so he went in and took his seat,
choosing one at the right hand end of the first row of the
stalls&mdash;students&#8217; vernacular for the lowest row of the
theatre benches.</p>
<p>The theatre was lit with gas. It had whitewashed
walls bare as the walls of a barn; a permanent blackboard
faced the audience, and the air was suffocatingly
hot after the crisp, cold air of the streets. It would be
like this till about the middle of the lecture, when Alphonse
the porter would pull the rope of the skylight and ventilate
the place with an arctic blast.</p>
<p>This room, which had once been an anatomical theatre,
and always a lecture room, had known the erect form of
Lisfranc; the stooping shoulders of Majendie had cast
their shadow on its walls; Flourens had lectured here on
that subject of which he had so profound a knowledge&mdash;the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
brain; the echoes of this room had heard the foundations
of Medicine shift and change, the rank heresies
of yesterday voiced as the facts of to-day&mdash;and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>
<p>Adams, having opened his notebook and sharpened
his pencil, sat listening to the gas sizzling above his
head; then he turned for a moment and glanced at the
men behind him: the doctor from Vienna in a broadly
braided frock-coat with satin facings, betraying himself
to all men by the end of the clinical thermometer protruding
from his waistcoat pocket; the two Japanese gentlemen&mdash;brown,
incurious, and inscrutable&mdash;men from
another world, come to look on; the republican from
Liberia, and the rest. Then he turned his head, for the
door on the floor of the theatre had opened, giving entrance
to Thénard.</p>
<p>Thénard was a smallish man in a rather shabby frock-coat;
his beard was scant, pointed, and gray-tinged; he
had a depressed expression, the general air of a second-rate
tradesman on the verge of bankruptcy; and as he
entered and crossed to the <i>estrade</i> where the lecture
table stood and the glass of water, he shouted some words
vehemently and harshly to Alphonse, the theatre attendant,
who, it seemed, had forgotten to place the box of
coloured chalks on the table&mdash;the sacred chalks which the
lecturer used for colouring his diagrams on the blackboard.</p>
<p>One instantly took a dislike to this shabby-looking
<i>bourgeois</i>, with the harsh, irritable voice, but after awhile,
as the lecture went on, one forgot him. It was not the
profundity of the man&#8217;s knowledge, great though it was,
that impressed one; or the subtlety of his reasoning or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
the lucidity of his expression, but his earnestness, his
obvious disregard for everything earthly but Truth.</p>
<p>This was borne in on one by every expression of his
face, every gesture of his body, every word and every
tone and inflection of his voice.</p>
<p>This was the twelfth and last lecture of the course.
It was on the &#8220;Brain Conceived as a Machine Pure and
Simple.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a cold and pitiless lecture, striking at the
root of poetry and romance, speaking of religions, not
religion, and utterly ignoring the idea which stands
poised like a white-winged Victory over all other ideas&mdash;the
Soul.</p>
<p>It was pitiless because it did these things, and it was
terrible because it was spoken by Thénard, for he was
just standing there, a little, oldish man, terribly convincing
in his simplicity, absolutely without prejudice,
as ready to acknowledge the soul and its attributes as to
refuse them, standing there twiddling his horsehair
watch-chain, and speaking from the profundity of his
knowledge with, at his elbow, a huge army of facts,
instances, and cases, not one of which did not support
his logical deductions.</p>
<p>I wish I could print his lecture in full. I can only
give some few sentences taken at haphazard from the
peroration.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fundamental basis of all morality can be expressed
by the words Left&mdash;or Right. &#8216;Shall I take
the path to the right, when my child is being threatened
with death by a pterodactyl, or shall I take the path to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
the left when a mastodon is threatening to put a foot on
my dinner?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;The prehistoric man asking himself that question
in the dawn of time laid the foundation of the world&#8217;s
morality. Do we know how he answered it? Yes&mdash;undoubtedly
he saved his dinner.</p>
<p>&#8220;The prehistoric woman crouching in the ferns,
wakened from sleep by the cries of her child on the left
and the shouting of her man on the right, found herself
face to face with the question, &#8216;Shall I court self-destruction
in attempting to save <i>It</i>, or shall I seek safety
with <i>Him</i>?&#8217; Do we know how she answered that question?
Undoubtedly she took the path to the left.</p>
<p>&#8220;The woman&#8217;s Right was the man&#8217;s Left, and she
took it not from any motive of goodness but just because
her child appealed to her as powerfully as his dinner
appealed to the man. And which was the nobler instinct?
In prehistoric times, gentlemen, they were both equally
noble, for the instinct of the man was as essential to the
fact that you and I are here gathered together in enlightened
Paris, as the instinct of the woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right or Left? That is still the essence of morals&mdash;all
the rest is embroidery. Whilst I am talking to
you now, service is being held at the Madeleine, the
Bourse is closed (looking at his watch), but other gaming
houses are opening. The <i>Café de Paris</i> is filling, the Little
Sisters of the Poor are visiting the sick.</p>
<p>&#8220;We feel keenly that some people are doing good and
some people are doing evil. We wonder at the origin
of it all, and the answer comes from the prehistoric forest.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I am Determination. I can choose the Right or I can
choose the Left. Whilst dwelling in the man&#8217;s heart
my choice lies <i>that</i> way, in the woman&#8217;s heart <i>that</i> way.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I am not religion, but between the man and the
woman I have created an essential antagonism of motive
which will be the basis of all future religions and
systems of ethics. I have already dimly demarcated
a line between ferocity and greed, and a thing which
has yet no name, but which will in future ages be
called Love.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;<i>I</i> am a constant quantity, but the dim plan I have
traced in the plastic brain will be used by the ever-building
years; spires and domes shall fret the skies, priests unroll
their scrolls of papyri, infinite developments of the simple
basic Right and Left laid down by me shall combine to
build a Pantheon of a million shrines to a million gods&mdash;who
are yet only three: the tramp of the mastodon, the
cry of the child in the pterodactyl&#8217;s grip, and myself,
who in future years shall be the only surviving god of the
three&mdash;Determination.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Pineal Gland had no known function, so Descartes
declared it to be the seat of the soul. &#8216;There
is nothing in here. Let us put something in,&#8217; and he
put in the idea of the soul. That was the old method.</p>
<p>&#8220;Morphology teaches us now that the Pineal Gland
is the last vestige of an eye which once belonged to a
reptile long extinct. That is the new method; the results
are not so pretty, but they are more exact.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have finished your post-graduate work, and
I suppose you are about to leave Paris like the others.
Have you any plans?&#8221;</p>
<p>The lecture was over, the audience was pouring out
of the theatre, and Adams was talking to Thénard, whom
he knew personally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, no,&#8221; said Adams. &#8220;None very fixed just at
present. Of course I shall practise in my own country,
but I can&#8217;t quite see the opening yet.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>DR. DUTHIL</h3>
</div>

<p>Thénard, with his case-book and a bundle of
papers under his arm, stood for a moment in
thought. Then he suddenly raised his chin.</p>
<p>&#8220;How would you like to go on a big-game shooting
expedition to the Congo?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask a child would it like pie,&#8221; said the American,
speaking in English. Then, in French, &#8220;Immensely,
monsieur. Only it is impossible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s just it,&#8221; said Thénard. &#8220;A patient
of mine, Captain Berselius, is starting on a big-game
shooting expedition to the Congo. He requires
a medical man to accompany him, and the salary
is two thousand francs a month and all things
found&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Adams&#8217;s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two thousand a month!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; he is a very rich man. His wife is a
patient of mine. When I was visiting her yesterday
the Captain put the thing before me&mdash;in fact,
gave me <i>carte blanche</i> to choose for him. He requires
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
the services of a medical man&mdash;an Englishman if
possible&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m an American,&#8221; said Adams.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the same thing,&#8221; replied Thénard, with a
little laugh. &#8220;You are all big and strong and fond
of guns and danger.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had taken Adams by the arm and was leading
him down the passage toward the entrance hall of the
hospital.</p>
<p>&#8220;The primitive man is strong in you all, and that
is why you are so vital and important, you Anglo-Saxons,
Anglo-Celts, and Anglo-Teutons. Come in here.&#8221;</p>
<p>He opened the door of one of the house-surgeon&#8217;s
rooms.</p>
<p>A youngish looking man, with a straw-coloured beard,
was seated before the fire, with a cigarette between his lips.</p>
<p>He rose to greet Thénard, was introduced to Adams,
and, drawing an old couch a bit from the wall, he bade
his guests be seated.</p>
<p>The armchair he retained himself. One of the legs
was loose, and he was the only man in the Beaujon who
had the art of sitting on it without smashing it. This
he explained whilst offering cigarettes.</p>
<p>Thénard, like many another French professor, unofficially
was quite one with the students. He would snatch
a moment from his work to smoke a cigarette with them;
he would sometimes look in at their little parties. I
have seen him at a birthday party where the cakes and
ale, to say nothing of the cigarettes and the unpawned
banjo, were the direct products of a pawned microscope.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
I have seen him, I say, at a party like this, drinking a
health to the microscope as the giver of all the good things
on the table&mdash;he, the great Thénard, with an income of
fifteen to twenty thousand pounds a year, and a reputation
solid as the four massive text-books that stood to his
name.</p>
<p>&#8220;Duthil,&#8221; said Thénard, &#8220;I have secured, I believe,
a man for our friend Berselius.&#8221; He indicated Adams
with a half laugh, and Dr. Duthil, turning in his chair,
regarded anew the colossus from the States. The great,
large-hewn, cast-iron visaged Adams, beside whom
Thénard looked like a shrivelled monkey and Duthil like
a big baby with a beard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Duthil.</p>
<p>&#8220;A better man than Bauchardy,&#8221; said Thénard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Much,&#8221; replied Duthil.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who, then, was Bauchardy?&#8221; asked Adams, amused
rather by the way in which the two others were discussing
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bauchardy?&#8221; said Duthil. &#8220;Why, he was the last
man Berselius killed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Silence,&#8221; said Thénard, then turning to Adams,
&#8220;Berselius is a perfectly straight man. On these hunting
expeditions of his he invariably takes a doctor with
him; he is not a man who fears death in the least, but he
has had bitter experience of being without medical assistance,
so he takes a doctor. He pays well and is entirely
to be trusted to do the right thing, as far as money goes.
On that side the contract is all right. But there is another
side&mdash;the character of Berselius. A man, to be the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
companion of Captain Berselius, needs to be big and
strong in body and mind, or he would be crushed by the
hand of Captain Berselius. Yes, he is a terrible man in
a way&mdash;<i>un homme affreux</i>&mdash;a man of the tiger type&mdash;and
he is going to the country of the big baboons, where
there is the freedom of action that the soul of such a man
desires&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact,&#8221; said Adams, &#8220;he is a villain, this Captain
Berselius?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; said Thénard, &#8220;not in the least. Be quiet,
Duthil, you do not know the man as I do. I have studied
him; he is a Primitive&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An Apache,&#8221; said Duthil. &#8220;Come, dear master,
confess that from the moment you heard that this
Berselius was intent on another expedition, you determined
to throw a foreigner into the breach. &#8216;No
more French doctors, if possible,&#8217; said you. Is not
that so?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thénard laughed the laugh of cynical confession,
buttoning his overcoat at the same time and preparing
to go.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there may be something in what you say,
Duthil. However, there the offer is&mdash;a sound one
financially. Yes. I must say I dread that two thousand
francs a month will prove a fatal attraction, and, if Mr.
Adams does not go, some weaker man will. Well,
I must be off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One moment,&#8221; said Adams. &#8220;Will you give me
this man&#8217;s address? I don&#8217;t say I will take the post,
but I might at least go and see him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; replied Thénard, and taking one of his
own cards from his pocket, he scribbled on the back of it&mdash;</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>CAPTAIN ARMAND BERSELIUS</p>
<p>14 AVENUE MALAKOFF</p>
</div>

<p>Then he went off to a consultation at the Hotel Bristol
on a Balkan prince, whose malady, hitherto expressed by
evil living, had suddenly taken an acute and terrible turn
and Adams found himself alone with Dr. Duthil.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is Thénard all over,&#8221; said Duthil. &#8220;He is
the high priest of modernism. He and all the rest of the
neurologists have divided up devilment into provinces,
and labelled each province with names all ending in <i>enia</i>
or <i>itis</i>. Berselius is a Primitive, it seems; this Balkan
prince is&mdash;I don&#8217;t know what they call him&mdash;sure to be
something Latin, which does not interfere in the least
with the fact that he ought to be boiled alive in an antiseptic
solution. Have another cigarette.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know anything special against Captain
Berselius?&#8221; asked Adams, taking the cigarette.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never even seen the man,&#8221; replied Duthil,
&#8220;but from what I have heard, he is a regular buccaneer of
the old type, who values human life not one hair. Bauchardy,
that last doctor he took with him, was a friend
of mine. Perhaps that is why I feel vicious about the
man, for he killed Bauchardy as sure as I didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Killed him?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; with hardship and overwork.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Overwork?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Mon Dieu</i>, yes. Dragged him through swamps after
his infernal monkeys and tigers, and Bauchardy died in
the hospital at Marseilles of spinal meningitis, brought
on by the hardships of the expedition&mdash;died as mad as
Berselius himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As mad as Berselius?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; this infernal Berselius seemed to have infected
him with his own hunting fever, and Bauchardy&mdash;<i>mon
Dieu</i>, you should have seen him during his illness,
shooting imaginary elephants, and calling for Berselius.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What I want to get at is this,&#8221; said Adams. &#8220;Was
Bauchardy driven into these swamps you speak of, and
made to hunt against his will&mdash;treated cruelly, in fact&mdash;or
did Berselius take his own share of the hardships?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His own share! Why, from what I can understand,
he did all the hunting. A man of iron with the ferocity
of a tiger&mdash;a very devil, who made others follow him as
poor Bauchardy did, to his death&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Adams, &#8220;this man interests me somehow,
and I intend to have a look at him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The pay is good,&#8221; said Duthil, &#8220;but I have warned
you fully, if Thénard hasn&#8217;t. Good evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Rue Dijon, where Adams lived, was a good way
from the Beaujon. He made his way there on foot, studying
the proposition as he went.</p>
<p>The sporting nature of the proposal coming from the
sedate Thénard rather tickled him.</p>
<p>&#8220;He wants to pit me against this Berselius,&#8221; said Adams
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
to himself, &#8220;same as if we were dogs. That&#8217;s the long
and short of it. Yes, I can understand his meaning in
part; he&#8217;s afraid if Berselius engages some week-kneed
individual, he&#8217;ll give the weak-kneed individual more
than he can take. He wants to stick a six-foot Yankee
in the breach, instead of a five-foot froggie, all absinthe and
cigarette ends. Well, he was frank, at all events. Hum,
I don&#8217;t like the proposition&mdash;and yet there&#8217;s something&mdash;there&#8217;s
something&mdash;there&#8217;s something about it I <i>do</i>
like. Then there&#8217;s the two thousand francs a month, and
not a penny out of pocket, and there&#8217;s the Congo, and
the guggly-wuggly alligators, and the great big hairy apes,
and the feel of a gun in one&#8217;s hand again. Oh, my!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All the same, it&#8217;s funny,&#8221; he went on, as he drew
near the Boulevard St. Michel. &#8220;When Thénard spoke
of Berselius there was something more than absence of
friendship in his tone. Can old man Thénard have a
down on this Berselius and does he in his heart of hearts
imagine that by allotting P. Quincy Adams to the post
of physician extraordinary to the expedition, he will get
even with the Captain? My friend, remember that hymn
the English Salvationists were yelling last Sunday outside
the American Presbyterian Church in the Rue de Berry&mdash;&#8216;Christian,
walk carefully, danger is near.&#8217; Not a bad
motto for Paris, and I will take it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He walked into the <i>Café d&#8217;Italie</i>, which, as everyone
knows, is next to Mouton&#8217;s, the pork shop, on the left-hand
side of the Boul&#8217; Miche, as you go from the Seine;
called for a boc, and then plunged into a game of dominoes
with an art student in a magenta necktie, whom he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
had never met before, and whom, after the game, he would,
a million to one, never meet again.</p>
<p>That night, when he had blown out his candle, he
reviewed Thénard&#8217;s proposition in the dark. The more
he looked at it the more attraction it had for him, and&mdash;&#8220;Whatever
comes of it,&#8221; said he to himself, &#8220;I will go
and see this Captain Berselius to-morrow. The animal
seems worth the trouble of inspection.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>CAPTAIN BERSELIUS</h3>
</div>

<p>Next morning was chill and a white Seine mist
wrapped Paris in its folds. It clung to the trees
of the Avenue Champs Elysées, and it half veiled
the Avenue Malakoff as Adams&#8217;s <i>fiacre</i> turned into that
thoroughfare and drew up at No. 14, a house with
a carriage drive, a porter&#8217;s lodge, and wrought-iron gates.</p>
<p>The American paid off his cab, rang at the porter&#8217;s
lodge, was instantly admitted, and found himself in an
enormous courtyard domed in with glass. He noted
the orange and aloe trees growing in tubs of porcelain,
as the porter led him to the big double glass doors giving
entrance to the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got the money,&#8221; thought Adams, as the glass
swing-door was opened by a flunkey as magnificent as
a Lord Mayor&#8217;s footman, who took the visitor&#8217;s card and
the card of M. Thénard and presented them to a functionary
with a large pale face, who was seated at a table close
to the door.</p>
<p>This personage, who was as soberly dressed as an archbishop,
and had altogether a pontifical air, raised himself
to his feet and approached the visitor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has monsieur an appointment&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Adams. &#8220;I have come to see your master
on business. You can take him my card&mdash;yes, that
one&mdash;Dr. Adams, introduced by Dr. Thénard.&#8221;</p>
<p>The functionary seemed perplexed; the early hour,
the size of the visitor, his decided manner, all taken
together, were out of routine. Only for a moment he
hesitated, then leading the way across the warm and
flower-scented hall, he opened a door and said, &#8220;Will
monsieur take a seat?&#8221; Adams entered a big room, half
library, half museum; the door closed behind him, and
he found himself alone.</p>
<p>The four walls of the room showed a few books, but
were mostly covered with arms and trophies of the chase.
Japanese swords in solid ivory scabbards, swords of the
old Samurai so keen that a touch of the edge would
divide a suspended hair. Malay krisses, double-handed
Chinese execution swords; old pepper-pot revolvers, such
as may still be found on the African coast; knob-kerries,
assegais, steel-spiked balls swinging from whips of raw
hide; weapons wild and savage and primitive as those
with which Attila drove before him the hordes of the
Huns, and modern weapons of to-day and yesterday; the
big elephant gun which has been supplanted by the express
rifle; the deadly magazine rifle, the latest products of
Schaunard of the Rue de la Paix and Westley Richards
of London.</p>
<p>Adams forgot time as he stood examining these things;
then he turned his attention to the trophies, mounted by
Borchard of Berlin, that prince of taxidermists. Here
stood a great ape, six feet and over&mdash;<i>monstrum horrendum</i>&mdash;head flung back,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
mouth open, shouting aloud to the
imagination of the gazer in the language that was spoken
ere the earliest man lifted his face to the chill mystery of
the stars. In the right fist was clutched the branch
of a M&#8217;bina tree, ready lifted to dash your brains
out&mdash;the whole thing a miracle of the taxidermist&#8217;s
art. Here crawled an alligator on a slab of granitic
rock; an alligator&mdash;that is to say, the despair of the
taxidermist&mdash;for you can make nothing out of an alligator;
alive and not in motion he looks stuffed, stuffed,
he looks just the same. Hartbeest, reedbuck, the
maned and huge-eared roan antelope, gazelle, and bush-buck,
all were here, skull or mask, dominated by the
vast head of the wildebeest, with ponderous sickle-curved
horns.</p>
<p>Adams had half completed the tour of the walls when
the door of the library opened and Captain Berselius came
in. Tall, black-bearded and ferocious looking&mdash;that
was the description of man Adams was prepared to meet.
But Captain Berselius was a little man in a frock-coat,
rather worn, and slippers. He had evidently been in
<i>négligé</i> and, to meet the visitor, slipped into the frock-coat,
or possibly he was careless, taken up with abstractions,
dreams, business affairs, plans. He was rather
stout, with an oval, egg-shaped face; his beard, sparse
and pointed and tinged with gray, had originally been light
of hue; he had pale blue eyes, and he had a perpetual
smile.</p>
<p>It is to be understood by this that Captain Berselius&#8217;s
smile was, so to speak, hung on a hair-trigger; there was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
always a trace of it on his face round the lips, and in conversation
it became accentuated.</p>
<p>At first sight, during your first moments of meeting
with Captain Berselius, you would have said, &#8220;What
a happy-faced and jolly little man!&#8221;</p>
<p>Adams, completely taken aback by the apparition
before him, bowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have the pleasure of speaking to Dr. Adams, introduced
by Dr. Thénard?&#8221; said Captain Berselius, motioning
the visitor to a chair. &#8220;Pray take a seat, take a seat&mdash;yes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
He took a seat opposite the American,
crossed his legs in a comfortable manner, caressed his
chin, and whilst chatting on general subjects stared full
at the newcomer, as though Adams had been a statue,
examining him, without the least insolence, but in that
thorough manner with which a purchaser examines the
horse he is about to buy or the physician of an insurance
company a proposer.</p>
<p>It was now that Adams felt he had to deal with no common
man in Captain Berselius.</p>
<p>Never before had he conversed with a person so calmly
authoritative, so perfectly at ease, and so commanding.
This little commonplace-looking, negligently dressed man,
talking easily in his armchair, made the spacious Adams
feel small and of little account in the world. Captain
Berselius filled all the space. He was <i>the</i> person in that
room; Adams, though he had personality enough, was
nowhere. And now he noticed that the perpetual smile
of the Captain had no relation to mirth or kindliness, it
was not worn as a mask, for Captain Berselius had no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
need for masks; it was a mysterious and unaccountable
thing that was there.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know M. Thénard intimately?&#8221; said Captain
Berselius, turning suddenly from some remarks he was
making on the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; said Adams. &#8220;I have attended his clinics;
beyond that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; said the other. &#8220;Are you a good shot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fair, with the rifle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have had to do with big game?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have shot bear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;These are some of my trophies,&#8221; said the Captain,
rising to his feet. He took his stand before the great ape
and contemplated it for a moment. &#8220;I shot him near
M&#8217;Bassa on the West Coast two years ago. The natives
at the village where we were camping said there was a big
monkey in a tree near by. They seemed very much
frightened, but they led me to the tree. He knew what
a gun was; he knew what a man was, too. He knew
that his hour of death had arrived, and he came roaring
out of the tree to meet me. But when he was on the
ground, with the muzzle of my Mannlicher two yards from
his head, all his rage vanished. He saw death, and to
shut out the sight he put his big hands before his face&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shot him through the heart. This room does not
represent all my work. The billiard room and the hall
contain many of my trophies; they are interesting to me,
for each has a history. That tiger skin there in front of
the fireplace once covered a thing very much alive. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
was a full-sized brute, and I met him in a rice field near
Benares. I had not even time to raise my gun when he
charged. Then I was on my back and he was on top of
me. He had overshot the mark a bit&mdash;I was not even
scratched. I lay looking up at his whiskers; they seemed
thick as quills, and I counted them. I was dead to all
intents and purposes, so I felt no fear. That was the
lesson this gentleman taught me; it is as natural to be
dead as to be alive. I have never been afraid of
death since. Well, something must have distracted his
attention and frightened him, for he lifted himself,
passed over me like a cloud, and was gone. Well,
so much for the tiger. And now for business. Are
you prepared to act as medical attendant to my new
expedition?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Adams, &#8220;I would like a little time to
consider&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said Captain Berselius, taking out his
watch. &#8220;I will give you five minutes, as a matter of form.
Thénard, in a note to me this morning, informs me he has
given you all details as to salary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he gave me the details. As you give me so
short a time to make my decision about you, I suppose
you have already made your decision about me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolutely,&#8221; said Berselius. &#8220;Two minutes have
passed. Why waste the other three? For you have
already made up your mind to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adams sat down in a chair for a moment, and in that
moment he did a great deal of thinking.</p>
<p>He had never met a man before at all like Berselius.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
He had never before come across a man with such a tremendous
personality. Berselius fascinated yet repelled
him. That there was evil in this man he felt, but he felt
also that there was good. Much evil and much good.
And beyond this he divined an animal ferocity latent&mdash;the
ferocity of a tiger&mdash;a cold and pitiless and utterly
divorced from reason ferociousness, the passion of a
primitive man, who had never known law except the
law of the axe wielded by the strongest. And yet there
was something in the man that he liked. He knew by
Berselius&#8217;s manner that if he did not take the offer now, he
would lose it. He reckoned with lightning swiftness that
the expedition would bring him in solid cash enough to
start in a small way in the States. He was as poor as Job,
as hungry for adventure as a schoolboy, and he only had
a moment to decide in.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many men are making up your party?&#8221; suddenly
asked Adams.</p>
<p>&#8220;You and I alone,&#8221; replied Berselius, putting his watch
in his pocket to indicate that the time was almost expired.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will come,&#8221; said Adams, and it seemed to him that
he said the words against his will.</p>
<p>Captain Berselius went to a writing table, took a sheet
of paper and wrote carefully and with consideration for the
space of some five minutes. Then he handed the paper
to Adams. &#8220;These are the things you want,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;I am an old campaigner in the wilds, so you will excuse
me for specifying them. Go for your outfit where you
will, but for your guns to Schaunard, for he is the best.
Order all accounts to be sent in to my secretary, M.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
Pinchon. He will settle them. Your salary you can
take how you will. If it is useful to you, I can give you a
cheque now on the Crédit Lyonnais, if you will state the
amount.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, thank you,&#8221; said Adams. &#8220;I have
quite sufficient money for my needs, and, if it is the same
to you, I would rather pay for my outfit myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As you please,&#8221; said Captain Berselius, quite indifferently.
&#8220;But Schaunard&#8217;s account and the account
for drugs and instruments you will please send to M.
Pinchon; they are part of the expedition. And now,&#8221;
looking at his watch, &#8220;will you do me the pleasure of
staying to <i>déjeuner</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>Adams bowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will notify you to-night at your address the exact
date we start,&#8221; said Captain Berselius as he led
the way from the room. &#8220;It will be within a fortnight.
My yacht is lying at Marseilles, and will take
us to Matadi, which will be our base. She will be
faster than the mail-boats and very much more comfortable.&#8221;</p>
<p>They crossed the hall, Captain Berselius opened a door,
motioned his companion to enter, and Adams found
himself in a room, half morning room, half boudoir. A
bright log fire was burning, and on either side of the fireplace
two women&mdash;a girl of about eighteen and a woman
of thirty-five or so&mdash;were seated.</p>
<p>The elder woman, Madame Berselius, a Parisienne,
pale, stout, yet well-proportioned, with almond-shaped
eyes; full lips exquisitely cut in the form of the true cupid&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
bow; and with a face vigorous enough, but veiled by an
expression at once mulish, blindish, and indolent&mdash;was
a type.</p>
<p>The type of the poodle woman, the parasite. With the
insolent expression of a Japanese lady of rank, an insult
herself to the human race, you will see her everywhere in
the highest social ranks of society. At the Zoölogical
Gardens of Madrid on a Sunday, when the grandees
of Spain take their pleasure amidst the animals at Longchamps,
in Rotten Row, Washington Square, Unter den
Linden, wherever money is, growing like an evil fungus,
she flourishes.</p>
<p>Opposite Madame Berselius sat her daughter, Maxine.</p>
<p>Adams, after his first glance at the two women, saw
only Maxine.</p>
<p>Maxine had golden-brown hair, worn after the fashion
of Cléo de Mérode&#8217;s, gray eyes, and a wide mouth, with
pomegranate-red lips. Goethe&#8217;s dictum that the highest
beauty is unobtainable without something of disproportion
was exemplified in the case of Maxine Berselius. &#8220;Her
mouth is too wide,&#8221; said the women, who, knowing nothing
of the philosophy of art, hit upon the defect that was
Maxine&#8217;s main charm.</p>
<p>Berselius introduced Adams to his wife and daughter,
and scarcely had he done so than a servant, in the blue-and-gold
livery of the house, flung open the door and
announced that <i>déjeuner</i> was served.</p>
<p>Adams scarcely noticed the room into which they
passed; a room whose scheme of colour was that watery
green which we associate with the scenery of early spring,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
the call of the cuckoo, and the river echoes where the weir
foams and the willow droops.</p>
<p>The tapestry hanging upon the walls did not distract
from this scheme. Taken from some château of Provence,
and old almost as the story of Nicolete, it showed ladies
listening to shepherds who played on flutes, capering
lambs, daffodils blowing to the winds of early spring under
a sky gray and broken by rifts of blue.</p>
<p>Adams scarcely noticed the room, or the tapestry, or
the food placed before him; he was entirely absorbed
by two things, Maxine and Captain Berselius.</p>
<p>Berselius&#8217;s presence at the table evidently cast silence
and a cloak of restraint upon the women. You could
see that the servants who served him dreaded him to the
very tips of their fingers, and, though he was chatting
easily and in an almost paternal manner, his wife and
daughter had almost the air of children, nervous, and
on their very best behaviour. This was noticeable,
especially, in Madame Berselius. The beautiful, indolent,
arrogant face became a very humble face indeed
when she turned it on the man who was evidently, literally,
her lord and master. Maxine, though oppressed by the
presence, wore a different air; she seemed abstracted
and utterly unconscious of what a beautiful picture she
made against the old-world tapestry of spring.</p>
<p>Her eyes sometimes met the American&#8217;s. They scarcely
spoke to each other once during the meal, yet their eyes
met almost as frequently as though they had been conversing.
As a matter of fact, Adams was a new type of
man to her, and on that account interesting; very different
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
was this son of Anak, with the restful, forceful face, to the
curled and scented dandies of the Chaussée d&#8217;Antin, the
&#8220;captains with the little moustaches,&#8221; the frequenters
of the <i>foyer de Ballet</i>, the cigarette-dried mummies of
the Grand Club. It was like the view of a mountain to
a person who had only known hills.</p>
<p>Maxine, in her turn, was a new type of woman to
Adams. This perfect flower from the Parisian hot-house
was the rarest and most beautiful thing he had met in the
way of womanhood. She seemed to him a rose only just
unfolded, unconscious of its own freshness and beauty
as of the dew upon its petals, and saying to the world, by
the voice of its own loveliness, &#8220;Behold me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Captain Berselius, as he took leave of
his guest in the smoking room, &#8220;I will let you know
to-night the day and hour of our departure. All my
business in Paris will be settled this afternoon. You had
better come and see me the day before we start, so that
we can make our last arrangements. <i>Au revoir.</i>&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>SCHAUNARD</h3>
</div>

<p>The young man turned down the Avenue Malakoff,
after he had left Berselius&#8217;s house, in the direction
of the Avenue des Champs Elysées.</p>
<p>In twenty-four hours a complete change had taken
place in his life. His line of travel had taken a new
and most unexpected course; it was as though a train
on the North German had, suddenly, by some mysterious
arrangement of points and tracks, found itself on the
Paris-Lyons and Mediterranean Railway.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon the prospect before him, though
vague enough, was American. A practice in some big
central American town. It would be a hard fight, for
money was scanty, and in medicine, especially in the
States, advertisement counts for very much.</p>
<p>All that was changed now, and the hard, definite
prospect that had elbowed itself out of vagueness stood
before him: Africa, its palms and poisonous forests, the
Congo&mdash;Berselius.</p>
<p>Something else besides these things also stood before
him very definitely and almost casting them into shade.
Maxine.</p>
<p>Up to this, a woman had never stood before him as a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
possible part of his future, if we except Mary Eliza Summers,
the eleven-year-old daughter of old Abe Summers,
who kept the store in Dodgeville, Vermont, years ago&mdash;that
is to say, when Paul Quincy Adams was twelve, an
orchard-robbing hooligan, whose chief worry in life was
that, though he could thrash his eldest brother left-handed,
he was condemned by the law of entail to wear his old
pants.</p>
<p>When a man falls in love with a woman&mdash;really in
love&mdash;though the attainment of his desire be all but
impossible, he has reached the goal of life; no tide can
take him higher toward the Absolute. He has reached
life&#8217;s zenith, and never will he rise higher, even though
he live to wield a sceptre or rule armies.</p>
<p>Adams reached the Place de la Concorde on foot,
walking and taking his way mechanically, and utterly
unconscious of the passers-by.</p>
<p>He was studying in minute detail Maxine Berselius,
the pose of her head outlined against the tapestry, the
curves of her lips that could speak so well without speaking,
the little shell-like ears, the brown-gold coils of her
hair, her hands, her dress.</p>
<p>He was standing undetermined as to his route, and
whether he would cross over to the Rue St. Honoré or
turn toward the Seine, when someone gripped his arm
from behind, and, turning, he found himself face to face
with Dr. Stenhouse, an English physician who had set
up in Paris, practising in the Boulevard Haussmann and
flourishing exceedingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this is luck,&#8221; said Stenhouse. &#8220;I lost your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
address, or I would have written, asking you to come
and see us. I remembered it was over on the other side
of the water somewhere, but where exactly I could not
remember. What are you doing with yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing, just at present.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, see here. I&#8217;m going to the Rue du Mont Thabor
to see a patient; walk along with me&mdash;it&#8217;s quite close,
just behind the Rue St. Honoré.&#8221;</p>
<p>They crossed the Place de la Concorde.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have finished your post-graduate work, I expect,&#8221;
said Stenhouse. &#8220;Are you going to practise in the
States?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately, I may,&#8221; replied Adams. &#8220;I have always
intended doing so; but I have to feel my way very cautiously,
for the money market is not in a particularly
flourishing state with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good heavens!&#8221; said Stenhouse, &#8220;when is it with
a medical man, especially when he is just starting? I&#8217;ve
been through that. See here, why don&#8217;t you start in
Paris?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Paris?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, this is the place to make money. You say you
are thinking of starting in some American city; well, let
me tell you, there are very few American cities so full of
rich Americans as Paris.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Adams, &#8220;the idea is not a bad one, but
just for the present I am fixed. I am going on a big-game
shooting expedition to the Congo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As doctor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and the salary is not bad&mdash;two thousand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
francs a month and everything found, to say nothing
of the fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the malaria?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, one has to run risks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whom are you going with?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A man called Berselius.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not Captain Berselius?&#8221; asked Stenhouse, stopping
dead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Captain Berselius, of No. 14 Avenue Malakoff.
I have just returned from having <i>déjeuner</i> with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stenhouse whistled. They were in the Rue du Mont
Thabor by this, in front of a small <i>café</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Adams, &#8220;what&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything,&#8221; replied the other. &#8220;This is the house
where my patient lives. Wait for me, for a moment, like
a good fellow. I shan&#8217;t detain you long, and then we can
finish our talk, for I have something to tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He darted into the <i>café</i> and Adams waited, watching
the passers-by and somewhat perturbed in mind. Stenhouse&#8217;s
manner impressed him uncomfortably, for, if
Captain Berselius had been the devil, the Englishman
could not have put more disfavour into his tone. And he
(Adams) had made a compact with Captain Berselius.</p>
<p>The Rue du Mont Thabor is a somewhat gloomy little
street, and it fitted Adams&#8217;s mood as he waited, watching
the passers-by and the small affairs of the little shops.</p>
<p>At the end of five minutes Stenhouse returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said Adams.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have had no luncheon yet,&#8221; replied Stenhouse. &#8220;I
have been so rushed. Come with me to a little place
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
I know in the Rue St. Honoré, where I can get a cup of
tea and a bun. We will talk then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Stenhouse, when he was seated at a little
marble-topped table with the cup of tea and the bun
before him. &#8220;You say you have engaged yourself to go
to the Congo with Captain Berselius.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. What do you know about him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just the difficulty. I can only say this, and
it&#8217;s between ourselves, the man&#8217;s name is a byword for
a brute and a devil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s cheerful,&#8221; said Adams.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mind you,&#8221; said Stenhouse, &#8220;he is in the very best
society. I have met him at a reception at the Elysée.
He goes everywhere. He belongs to the best clubs; he&#8217;s
a <i>persona grata</i> at more courts than one, and an intimate
friend of King Leopold of Belgium. His immense wealth,
or part of it, comes from the rubber industry&mdash;motor
tires and so forth. And he&#8217;s mad after big game. That&#8217;s
his pleasure&mdash;killing. He&#8217;s a killer. That is the best
description of the man. The lust of blood is in him, and
the astounding thing, to my mind, is that he is not a
murderer. He has killed two men in duels, and they say
that it is a sight to see him fighting. Mind you, when I
say &#8216;murderer,&#8217; I do not mean to imply that he is a man
who would murder for money. Give the devil his due.
I mean that he is quite beyond reason when aroused, and
if you were to hit Captain Berselius in the face he would
kill you as certain as I&#8217;ll get indigestion from that bun I
have just swallowed. The last doctor he took with him
to Africa died at Marseilles from the hardships he went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
through&mdash;not at the hands of Berselius, for that would
have aroused inquiry, but simply from the hardships of
the expedition; but he gave frightful accounts to the
hospital authorities of the way this Berselius had treated
the natives. He drove that expedition right away from
Libreville, in the French Congo, to God knows where.
He had it under martial law the whole time, clubbing
and thrashing the niggers at the least offence, and
shooting with his own hand two of them who tried to
desert.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must remember,&#8221; said Adams, taking up the
cudgels for Berselius and almost surprised himself at so
doing, &#8220;that an expedition like that, if it is not held together
by a firm hand, goes to pieces, and the result is disaster for
everyone. And you know what niggers are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There you are,&#8221; laughed Stenhouse. &#8220;The man has
obsessed you already, and you&#8217;ll come back, if you go, like
Bauchardy, the man who died in the hospital at Marseilles,
cursing Berselius, yet so magnetized by the power of the
chap that you would be ready to follow him again if he
said &#8216;Come,&#8217; and you had the legs to stand on. That
is how Bauchardy was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The man, undoubtedly, has a great individuality,&#8221;
said Adams. &#8220;Passing him in the street one might take
him for a very ordinary person. Meeting him for the first
time, he looks all good nature; that smile&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Always,&#8221; said Stenhouse. &#8220;Beware of a man with
a perpetual smile on his face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know that, but this smile of Berselius&#8217;s is not
worn as a cloak. It seems quite natural to the man, yet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
somehow bad, as if it came from a profound and natural
cynicism directed against all things&mdash;including all
things good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have put it,&#8221; said Stenhouse, &#8220;in four words.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, in spite of everything,&#8221; said Adams, &#8220;I believe
the man to have great good qualities: some instinct tells
me so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear sir,&#8221; said Stenhouse, &#8220;did you ever meet a
bad man worth twopence at his trade who had not good
qualities? The bad man who is half good&mdash;so to speak&mdash;is
a much more dangerous villain than the barrier
bully without heart or soul. When hell makes a super-excellent
devil, the devil puts goodness in just as a baker
puts soda in his bread to make it rise. Look at Verlaine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Adams, &#8220;I have promised Berselius,
and I will have to go. Besides, there are other
considerations.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was thinking of Maxine, and a smile lit up his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem happy enough about it,&#8221; said Stenhouse,
rising to go. &#8220;Well, &#8216;he who will to Cupar maun to
Cupar.&#8217; When do you start?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know yet, but I shall hear to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>They passed out into the Rue St. Honoré, where they
parted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good luck,&#8221; said Stenhouse, getting into a <i>fiacre</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; replied Adams, waving his hand.</p>
<p>Being in that quarter of the town, and having nothing
especial to do, he determined to go to Schaunard&#8217;s in the
Rue de la Paix, and see about his guns.</p>
<p>Schaunard personally superintends his own shop,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
which is the first gun-shop on the Continent of Europe.
Emperors visit him in person and he receives them as an
equal, though far superior to them in the science of sport.
An old man now, with a long white beard, he remembers
the fowling-pieces and rifles which he supplied to the
Emperor Maximilian before that unfortunate gentleman
started on his fatal expedition in search of a throne. He
is a mathematician as well as a maker of guns; his telescopic
sights and wind gauges are second to none in the
world, and his shop front in the Rue de la Paix exposes no
wares&mdash;it has just a wire blind, on which are blazoned
the arms of Russia, England, and Spain.</p>
<p>But, inside, the place is a joy to a rightly constituted
man. Behind glass cases the long processions of guns
and rifles, smooth, sleek, nut-brown and deadly, are a
sight for the eyes of a sportsman.</p>
<p>The duelling pistol is still a factor in Continental
life, and the cases containing them at Schaunard&#8217;s are
worth lingering over, for the modern duelling pistol is
a thing of beauty, very different from the murderous hair-trigger
machines of Count Considine&mdash;though just as
deadly.</p>
<p>To Schaunard, pottering amongst his wares, appeared
Adams.</p>
<p>The swing-door closed, shutting out the sound of the
Rue de la Paix, and the old gun-merchant came forward
through the silence of his shop to meet his visitor.</p>
<p>Adams explained his business. He had come to buy
some rifles for a big-game expedition. Captain Berselius
had recommended him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! Captain Berselius?&#8221; said Schaunard, and an
interested look came into his face. &#8220;True, he is a customer
of mine. As a matter of fact, his guns for his new
expedition are already boxed and directed for Marseilles.
Ah, yes&mdash;you require a complete outfit, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Adams. &#8220;I am going with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Going with Captain Berselius as a friend?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, as a doctor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True, he generally takes a doctor with him,&#8221; said
Schaunard, running his fingers through his beard. &#8220;Have
you had much experience amidst big game, and can you
make out your own list of requirements, or shall I help
you with my advice?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be very glad of your advice. No, I have
not had much experience in big-game shooting. I have
shot bears, that&#8217;s all&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Armand!&#8221; cried Schaunard, and a pale-faced young
man came forward from the back part of the shop.</p>
<p>&#8220;Open me this case.&#8221;</p>
<p>Armand opened a case, and the deft hand of the old
man took down a double-barrelled cordite rifle, light-looking
and of exquisite workmanship.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are the guns we shoot elephants with nowadays,&#8221;
said Schaunard, handling the weapon lovingly.
&#8220;A child could carry it, and there is nothing living it will
not kill.&#8221; He laughed softly to himself, and then directed
Armand to bring forward an elephant gun of the old pattern.
In an instant the young man returned, staggering
under the weight of the immense rifle, shod with a heel
of india-rubber an inch thick.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></p>
<p>Adams laughed, took the thing up with one hand,
and raised it to his shoulder as though it had been a
featherweight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said he, &#8220;here&#8217;s a gun worth shooting with.&#8221;</p>
<p>Schaunard looked on with admiration at the giant
handling the gigantic gun.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, for you,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it&#8217;s all very well. <i>Ma foi</i>,
but you suit one another, you both are of another day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God bless you,&#8221; said Adams, &#8220;you can pick me up
by the bushel in the States. I&#8217;m <i>small</i>. Say, how much
is this thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>That!</i>&#8221; cried Schaunard. &#8220;Why, what on earth
could you want with such an obsolete weapon as that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me&mdash;does this thing hit harder, gun for gun&mdash;not
weight for weight, mind you&mdash;but gun for gun&mdash;than
that double-barrel you are holding in your hands?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Schaunard, &#8220;it hits harder, just as
a cannon would hit harder, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have her,&#8221; said Adams. &#8220;I&#8217;ve taken a fancy
to her. See here, Captain Berselius is paying for my
guns; they are his, part of the expedition&mdash;I want this
as my own, and I&#8217;ll pay you for her out of my own pocket.
How much is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>Schaunard, whose fifty years of trading had explained
to him the fact that when an American takes a whim into
his head it is best for all parties to let him have his own
way, ran his fingers through his beard.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing has no price,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It is a curiosity.
But if you must have it&mdash;well, I will let you have it for two
hundred francs.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Done,&#8221; said Adams. &#8220;Have you any cartridges?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; replied Schaunard. &#8220;Heaps. That is
to say, I have the old cartridges, and I can have a couple
of hundred of them emptied and re-filled and percussioned.
Ah, well, monsieur, you must have your own
way. Armand, take the gun; have it attended to and
packed. And now that monsieur has his play-toy,&#8221;
finished the old man, with one of his silent little laughs,
&#8220;let us come to business.&#8221;</p>
<p>They did, and nearly an hour was spent whilst the
American chose a double hammerless-ejector cordite
rifle and a .256 sporting Mannlicher, for Schaunard was
a man who, when he took an interest in a customer, could
be very interesting.</p>
<p>When business was concluded Schaunard gave his
customer various tips as to the treatment of guns. &#8220;And
now,&#8221; said he, opening the door as Adams was taking his
departure, &#8220;I will give you one more piece of advice
about this expedition. It is a piece of private advice,
and I will trust you not to tell the Captain that I gave
it to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. What is the advice?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adams laughed as he turned on his heel, and Schaunard
laughed as he closed the door.</p>
<p>A passer-by might have imagined that the two men had
just exchanged a good joke.</p>
<p>Before Adams had taken three steps, the door of the
shop re-opened, and Schaunard&#8217;s voice called again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Monsieur.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; said Adams, turning.</p>
<p>&#8220;You need not pay me for the gun till you come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; said Adams, laughing. &#8220;I will call in and
pay you for it when I come back. <i>Au revoir.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Adieu.</i>&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>MARSEILLES</h3>
</div>

<p>On the day of departure Berselius was entertained
at <i>déjeuner</i> by the Cerele Militaire. He brought
Adams with him as a guest.</p>
<p>Nearly all the sporting members of the great club
were present to speed the man who after Schillings was
reckoned on the Continent the most adventurous big-game
hunter in the world.</p>
<p>Despite what Stenhouse, Duthil, and Schaunard had
said, Adams by this time inclined to a half-liking for
Berselius; the man seemed so far from and unconscious
of the little things of the world, so destitute of pettiness,
that the half liking which always accompanies respect
could not but find a place in Adams&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>Guest at a table surrounded by sixty of the wealthiest
and most powerful officers of a military nation, Berselius
did not forget his companion, but introduced him with
painstaking care to the chief men present, included him
in his speech of thanks, and made him feel that though
he was taking Berselius&#8217;s pay, he was his friend and on a
perfect social equality with him.</p>
<p>Adams felt this keenly. On qualifying first he had
obtained an appointment as travelling physician to an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
American, a prominent member of the New York smart
set, a man of twenty-two, a motorist, a yachtsman, clean
shaved as an actor and smug as a butler, one of those men
who make the great American nation so small in the eyes
of the world&mdash;the world that cannot see beyond the
servants&#8217; hall antics of New York society to the great plains
where the Adamses hew the wood and draw the water, build
the cities and bridge the rivers, and lay the iron roads,
making rail-heads of the roar of the Atlantic and the
thunder of the Pacific.</p>
<p>This gentleman treated Adams as a paid attendant and
in such a manner that Adams one morning lifted him from
his bed by the slack of his silk pajamas and all but drowned
him in his own bath.</p>
<p>He could not but remember the incident as he sat
watching Berselius so calm, so courtly, so absolutely
destitute of mannerism, so incontestably the superior,
in some magnetic way, of all the other men who were
present.</p>
<p>Maxine and M. Pinchon, the secretary, were to accompany
them to Marseilles.</p>
<p>A cold, white Paris fog covered the city that night as
they drove to the station, and the fog detonators and
horns followed them as they glided out slowly from
beneath the great glass roof. Slowly at first, then more
swiftly over rumbling bridges and clicking point, more
swiftly still, breaking from the fog-banked Seine valley,
through snarling tunnel and chattering cutting, faster
now and freer, by long lines of poplar trees, mist-strewn,
and moonlit ponds and fields, spectral white
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
roads, little winking towns; and now, as if drawn by
the magnetic south, swaying to the rock-a-bye of speed,
aiming for the lights of Dijon far away south, to the
tune of the wheels, &#8220;seventy-miles-an-hour&mdash;seventy-miles-an-hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>Civilization, whatever else she has done, has written
one poem, the &#8220;Rapide.&#8221; True to herself, she makes
it pay a dividend, and prostitutes it to the service of
stockbrokers, society folk, and gamblers bound for
Monaco&mdash;but what a poem it is that we snore through
between a day in Paris and a day in Marseilles. A poem,
swiftly moving, musical with speed, a song built up of
songs, telling of Paris, its chill and winter fog, of the
winter fields, the poplar trees and mist; vineyards of the
Côte d&#8217;Or; Provence with the dawn upon it, Tarascon
blowing its morning bugle to the sun; the Rhone, and
the vineyards, and the olives, and the white, white roads;
ending at last in that triumphant blast of music, light and
colour, Marseilles.</p>
<p><i>La Joconde</i>, Berselius&#8217;s yacht, was berthed at the Messagerie
wharf, and after <i>déjeuner</i> at the Hotel Noailles,
they took their way there on foot.</p>
<p>Adams had never seen the south before as Marseilles
shows it. The vivid light and the black shadows, the
variegated crowd of the Canabier Prolongue had for him
an &#8220;Arabian Nights&#8221; fascination, but the wharves held
a deeper fascination still.</p>
<p>Marseilles draws its most subtle charm from far away
in the past. Beaked triremes have rubbed their girding
cables against the wharves of the old Phocée; the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
sunshine of a thousand years has left some trace of its gold,
a mirage in the air chilled by the mistral and perfumed
by the ocean.</p>
<p>At Marseilles took place the meeting between Mary
Magdalen and Laeta Acilia, so delightfully fabled by
Anatole France. The Count of Monte Cristo landed
here after he had discovered his treasure, and here Caderouse
after the infamy at &#8220;La Reservée&#8221; watched old Dantès
starving to death. Multitudes of ships, fabled and real,
have passed from the harbour to countries curious and
strange, but never one of them to a stranger country than
that to which <i>La Joconde</i> was to bear Berselius and his
companion.</p>
<p>Gay as Naples with colour, piercing the blue sky
with a thousand spars, fluttering the flags of all nations
to the wind, shot through with the sharp rattle of winch-chains,
and perfumed with garlic, vanilla, fumes of coal
tar, and the tang of the sea, the wharves of Marseilles lay
before the travellers, a great counter eternally vibrating
to the thunder of trade; bales of carpets from the Levant,
tons of cheeses from Holland, wood from Norway, copra,
rice, tobacco, corn, silks from China and Japan, cotton
from Lancashire; all pouring in to the tune of the winch-pauls,
the cry of the stevedores, and the bugles of Port
Saint Jean, shrill beneath the blue sky and triumphant
as the crowing of the Gallic cock.</p>
<p>Between the breaks in the shipping one could see the
sea-gulls fishing and the harbour flashing, here spangled
with coal tar, here whipped to deepest sapphire by the
mistral; the junk shops, grog shops, parrot shops,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
rope-walks, ships&#8217; stores and factories lining the quays, each
lending a perfume, a voice, or a scrap of colour to the air
vibrating with light, vibrating with sound, shot through
with voices; hammer blows from the copper sheathers
in the dry docks, the rolling of drums from Port St. Nicholas,
the roaring of grain elevators, rattling of winch-chains,
trumpeting of ship sirens, mewing of gulls, the bells of
Notre Dame and the bells of St. Victor, all fused, orchestrated,
into one triumphant symphony beneath the clear
blue sky and the trade flags of the world.</p>
<p><i>La Joconde</i> was berthed beside a Messagerie boat which
they had to cross to reach her.</p>
<p>She was a palatial cruising yacht of twelve hundred
tons&#8217; burden, built somewhat on the lines of Drexel&#8217;s
<i>La Margharita</i>, but with less width of funnel.</p>
<p>It was two o&#8217;clock in the afternoon when they went on
board; all the luggage had arrived, steam was up, the port
arrangements had been made, and Berselius determined
to start at once.</p>
<p>Maxine kissed him, then she turned to Adams.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Bon voyage.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; said Adams.</p>
<p>He held her hand for a fraction of a second after his
grasp had relaxed.</p>
<p>Then she was standing on the deck of the Messagerie
boat, waving good-bye across the lane of blue water
widening between <i>La Joconde</i> and her berth mate.</p>
<p>At the harbour mouth, looking back across the blue
wind-swept water, he fancied he could still see her, a
microscopic speck in the great picture of terraced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
Marseilles, with its windows, houses, flags, and domes
glittering and burning in the sun.</p>
<p>Then the swell of the Gulf of Lyons took <i>La Joconde</i>
as a nurse takes an infant and rocks it on her knee, and
France and civilization were slowly wrapped from sight
under the veils of distance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>MATADI</h3>
</div>

<p>It was evening. <i>La Joconde</i>, Berselius&#8217;s yacht, lay
moored at the wharf of Matadi; warpling against
the starboard plates, whimpering, wimpling,
here smooth as glass, here eddied and frosted, a sea of
golden light, a gliding mirror, went the Congo.</p>
<p>A faint, faint haze dulled the palms away on the other
side; from the wharf, where ships were loading up with
rubber, ivory, palm-oil, and bales of gum copal, the roar
and rattle of steam-winches went across the water, far away
across the glittering water, where the red flamingoes were
flying, to that other shore where the palm trees showed
their fringe of hot and hazy green.</p>
<p>The impression of heat which green, the coolest of
all colours, can produce, damp heat, heart-weakening
heat, that is the master impression produced by the
Congo on the mind of man. All the other impressions
are&mdash;to paraphrase Thénard&mdash;embroideries on this.</p>
<p>Yet how many other impressions there are! The
Congo is Africa in a frank mood. Africa, laying her hand
on her heart and speaking, or rather, whispering the truth.</p>
<p>This great river flooding from Stanley Pool and far
away beyond, draws with it, like a moving dream, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
pictures of the roaring rapids and the silent pools, the
swamps filled with darkness of vegetation and murderous
life; the unutterable loneliness of vast forests. The water
brook of the hartbeest and antelope, it brings with it their
quiet reflections, just as it brings the awful horn and the
pig-like face of the rhinoceros. What things have not
slaked their thirst in this quiet water flooding past
Matadi&mdash;and wallowed in it? Its faint perfume
hints at that.</p>
<p>On the deck of the yacht, under the double awning,
Berselius was seated, and, close to him, Adams. They
had arrived only yesterday, and to-morrow they were proceeding
by rail to Leopoldville, which was to be the real
base of the expedition, leaving <i>La Joconde</i> behind at
Matadi.</p>
<p>The yacht would return to France.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a lot of stuff they are loading on those ships,&#8221;
said Adams, turning in his chair as the roar and rattle of
the winch chains, that had ceased for a moment, flared
up again like a flame of sound. &#8220;What are the exports
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gum copal&mdash;nuts&mdash;rubber&mdash;tusks&mdash;everything
you can get out of there,&#8221; answered Berselius, lazily
waving a hand to indicate the Congo basin.</p>
<p>Adams, leaning back in his deck chair, followed with
his eyes the sweep of Berselius&#8217;s hand, &#8220;over there&#8221;;
little did he dream of what those words held in their
magic.</p>
<p>Then Berselius went below.</p>
<p>The moon rose; lights speckled the misty wharf and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
a broad road of silver lay stretched across the moving
water to the other bank that, under the moonlight, lay
like a line of cotton-wool. It was the mist tangled by
and tangling the trees.</p>
<p>Adams paced the deck, smoking and occasionally
pausing to flip off his cigar-ash on the bulwark rail. He
was thinking of Maxine Berselius. She had come to
Marseilles to see them off, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Not a word had been exchanged between them that a
third person did not hear or might not have heard, yet
they had told each other the whole of that delightful story
in which the hero is I and the heroine You.</p>
<p>Adams on his side and Maxine on hers did not in the
least contemplate possibilities. A social river, wide as the
Congo, and flowing from as mysterious a source, lay between
them. Maxine was rich&mdash;so rich that the contrast of
her wealth with his own poverty shut the door for Adams
on the idea of marriage. He could not hope to take his
true place in the world for years, and he would not stoop
to take a woman&#8217;s money or assistance.</p>
<p>He was too big to go through a back door. No, he
would enter the social temple by walking between the
pillars of the portico, or smashing an entrance way through
the wall with his fist.</p>
<p>He was a type of the true American man, the individual
who trusts in himself; an unpleasant person very often,
but the most essentially male creation in Nature.</p>
<p>Though he could not contemplate Maxine as a wife,
he did as a woman. In a state of savagery he would have
carried her off in his arms; surrounded as he was by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
trammels of civilization, he contented himself with imagining
her in that position.</p>
<p>It is quite possible that no other woman would ever
inspire the same passion in him. He knew this, yet he
did not grumble; for he was practical, and his practical
nature had a part in his wildest dreams.</p>
<p>Go to New York and look at the twenty-storied,
sky-scrapers built by the Adamses. They look like houses
out of a story by Dean Swift. The wildest dreams of
architecture. Yet they don&#8217;t fall down; they serve their
purpose, for the dreamers who built them were at bottom
practical men.</p>
<p>As he paced the deck, smoking and contemplating the
moonlit river, Maxine gave place in his mind to her
father.</p>
<p>Berselius up to this had shown himself in no unfavourable
light. Up to this he had been almost companionable.</p>
<p>Almost! They had dined together, paced the deck
together, discussed all sorts of subjects, yet not by the
fraction of an inch had he advanced in his knowledge
of the man. A wall of ice divided Berselius from his
fellow-men. Between him and them a great gulf was
fixed, a gulf narrow enough to speak across, but of an
impenetrable depth. Berselius was always so assured,
so impassively calm, so authoritative, his conversation so
penetrative, so lit by intuition and acquired knowledge,
that Adams sometimes in his company felt that elation
which comes to us when we find ourselves in the
presence of a supreme mind. At other times this
overpowering personality weighed upon him so much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
that he would leave the saloon and pace the deck so
as to become himself again.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Next morning they left by rail for Leopoldville, where
they found waiting for them the <i>Leopold</i>, a shallow-draught
steamer of some two hundred tons.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>YANDJALI</h3>
</div>

<p>The <i>Leopold</i> was officered entirely by Belgians, and
it would have been almost impossible to find a
pleasanter set of men. Tilkins, the captain,
especially, won Adams&#8217;s regard. He was a huge man,
with a wife and family in Antwerp, and he was
eternally damning the Congo and wishing himself back
in Antwerp.</p>
<p>They transhipped to a smaller boat, the <i>Couronne</i>,
and one morning shortly after breakfast three strokes
on the steamer bell announced their approach to Yandjali.</p>
<p>Imagine a rough landing-stage, a handful of houses,
mostly mud-built, the funereal heat-green of palm and
banana, a flood of tropical sunshine lighting the little
wharf, crammed with bales of merchandise.</p>
<p>Such was Yandjali, and beyond Yandjali lay the
forest, and in front of Yandjali flowed the river, and
years ago <i>boom-boom</i> down the river&#8217;s shining surface,
from away up there where the great palms gave place to
reeds and water-grass, you might have heard the sound
of the hippopotami bellowing to the sun, a deep organ
note, unlike the sound emitted by any other creature
on earth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
You do not hear it now. The great brutes have
long ago been driven away by man.</p>
<p>On the wharf to greet the steamer stood the District
Commissioner, Commander Verhaeren; behind him six
or seven half-naked, savage-looking blacks, each topped
with a red fez and armed with an Albini rifle, stood
gazing straight before them with wrinkled eyes at the
approaching boat.</p>
<p>Verhaeren and Berselius were seemingly old friends;
they shook hands and Berselius introduced Adams;
then the three left the wharf and walked up to the District
Commissioner&#8217;s house, a frame building surrounded
by palm trees and some distance from the mud huts of
the soldiers and porters.</p>
<p>The Yandjali of this story, not to be confounded with
Yandjali notorious in Congo history for its massacre, is
not in a rubber district, though on the fringe of one;
it is a game district and produces cassava. The Congo
State has parcelled out its territory. There are the
rubber districts, the gum copal districts, the food districts,
and the districts where ivory is obtained. In each of
these districts the natives are made to work and bring
in rubber, gum copal, food, or ivory, as a tax. The
District Commissioner, or <i>Chef de Poste</i>, in each district
draws up a schedule of what is required. Such
and such a village must produce and hand over so
many kilos of rubber, or copal, so much cassava, so
many tusks, etc.</p>
<p>Verhaeren was a stout, pale-faced man, with a jet-black
beard, a good-tempered looking man, with that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
strange, lazy, semi-Oriental look which the Belgian
face takes when the owner of it is fixed to a post, with
nothing to do but oversee trade, and when the post is
on the confines of civilization.</p>
<p>Away up country, lost in the dim, green, heat-laden
wilderness, you will find a different type of man; more
alert and nervy, a man who never smiles, a preoccupied
looking man who, ten years or five years ago, lost his
berth in an office for misconduct, or his commission in
the army. A <i>déclassé</i>. He is the man who really drives
the Congo machine, the last wheel in the engine, but the
most important; the man whose deeds are not to be
written.</p>
<p>Verhaeren&#8217;s living room in the frame house was furnished
with steamer deck chairs, a table and some shelves.
Pinned to the wall and curling up at the corners was a
page torn from <i>La Gaudriole</i>, the picture of a girl in tights;
on one of the shelves lay a stack of old newspapers, on
another a stack of official papers, reports from subordinates,
invoices, and those eternal &#8220;official letters,&#8221; with
which the Congo Government deluges its employees,
and whose everlasting purport is &#8220;Get more ivory, get
more rubber, get more copal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verhaeren brought out some excellent cigars and a
bottle of Vanderhum, and the three men smoked and
talked. He had acted as Berselius&#8217;s agent for the expedition,
and had collected all the gun-bearers and porters
necessary, and a guide. It was Berselius&#8217;s intention
to strike a hundred miles west up river almost parallel
to the Congo, and then south into the heart of the elephant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
country. They talked of the expedition, but Verhaeren
showed little knowledge of the work and no
enthusiasm. The Belgians of the Congo have no feeling
for sport. They never hunt the game at their doors,
except for food.</p>
<p>When they had discussed matters, Verhaeren led
the way out for Berselius to inspect his arrangements.</p>
<p>The porters were called up. There were <i>forty</i> of them,
and Adams thought that he had never before seen such
a collection of depressed looking individuals; they were
muscular enough, but there was something in their faces,
their movements and their attitude, that told a tale of
spirits broken to servitude by terror.</p>
<p>The four gun-bearers and the headman were very
different. The headman was a Zappo Zap, a ferocious
looking nigger, fez-tipped, who could speak twenty words
of French, and who was nicknamed Félix. The gun-bearers
were recruited from the &#8220;soldiers&#8221; of the
state by special leave from headquarters.</p>
<p>Adams looked with astonishment at the immense
amount of luggage they were bringing. &#8220;Chop boxes,&#8221;
such as are used on the east coast, contained stores;
two big tents, a couple of &#8220;Roorkee&#8221; chairs, folding-beds
and tables, cork mattresses, cooking utensils, made up
the pile, to say nothing of the guns which had just been
taken from their cases.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you bring this thing for?&#8221; asked Berselius,
pointing to Adams&#8217;s elephant gun, which the Zappo Zap
headman was just stripping from its covering.</p>
<p>&#8220;To shoot with,&#8221; said Adams, laughing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>Berselius looked at the big man handling the big gun,
and gave a short laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, bring it,&#8221; said he; &#8220;but I don&#8217;t envy your gun-bearers.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Félix, the headman, did not seem of the same
opinion. The enormous rifle evidently appealed to his
ferocious heart. It was a god-gun this, and no mistake,
and its lustre evidently spread to Adams, the owner of it.</p>
<p>Félix was a very big man, almost as big as Adams:
a member of the great cannibal fighting tribe of Zappo
Zaps, he had followed Verhaeren, who had once held a
post in the Bena Pianga country, to Yandjali; he had a
sort of attachment for Verhaeren, which showed that he
possessed some sort of heart. All the Zappo Zaps have
been enrolled by the Congo Government as &#8220;soldiers&#8221;;
they have a bad name and cause a lot of heart-searching
to the Brussels administration, for when they are used in
punitive expeditions to burn villages of recalcitrant
rubber-getters, they, to use a local expression, &#8220;<i>will</i> eat
when they have killed.&#8221; When they are used <i>en masse</i>,
the old cannibal instinct breaks out; when the killing is
over they go for the killed, furious as dogs over bones.
God help the man who would come between them and
their food!</p>
<p>Of these men Félix was a fine specimen. A nature
man, ever ready to slay, and cruel as Death. A man
from the beginning of the world.</p>
<p>If Félix had possessed a wife, he and she might have
stood for the man and woman mentioned by Thénard
in his lecture.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></p>
<p>The basic man and woman in whose dim brains Determination
had begun to work, sketching the vague line on
either side of which lies the Right and Left of moral
action.</p>
<p>A true savage, never to be really civilized. For it is
the fate of the savage that he will never become one of us.
Do what you will and pray how you will, you will never
make up for the million years that have passed him by,
the million years during which the dim sketch which is
the basis of all ethics has lain in his brain undeveloped,
or developed only into a few fantastic and abortive God
shapes and devil shapes.</p>
<p>He will never become one of us. Extraordinary paradox&mdash;he
never can become a Leopold or a Félix Fuchs!</p>
<p>Berselius disbanded the porters with a wave of the
hand, and he and his companions began a round of the
station. Verhaeren, with a cigar in his mouth, led the way.</p>
<p>He opened the door of a go-down, and Adams in the
dim light, saw bale upon bale of stuff; gum copal it proved
to be, for Yandjali tapped a huge district where this stuff
is found, and which lies forty miles to the south. There
was also cassava in large quantities, and the place had a
heady smell, as if fermentation were going on amidst the
bales.</p>
<p>Verhaeren shut the door and led on till, rounding a
corner, a puff of hot air brought a stench which caused
Adams to choke and spit.</p>
<p>Verhaeren laughed.</p>
<p>It was the Hostage House that sent its poisonous
breath to meet them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>A native corporal and two soldiers stood at the palisade
which circled the Hostage House. The women and
children had just been driven back from the fields where
they had been digging and weeding, and they had been
served with their wretched dinners. They were eating
these scraps of food like animals, some in the sun amidst
the tufts of grass and mounds of ordure in the little yard,
some in the shadow of the house.</p>
<p>There were old, old women like shrivelled monkeys;
girls of twelve and fifteen, some almost comely;
middle-aged women, women about to become mothers,
and a woman who had become a mother during the past
night lying there in the shelter of the Hostage House.
There were little pot-bellied nigger children, tiny black
dots, who had to do their bit of work in the fields with
the others; and when the strangers appeared and looked
over the rail, these folk set up a crying and chattering,
and ran about distractedly, not knowing what new thing
was in store for them. They were the female folk and
children of a village, ten miles away south; they were
here as &#8220;hostages,&#8221; because the village had not produced
its full tale of cassava. They had been here over a month.</p>
<p>The soldiers laughed, and struck with the butts of
their rifles on the palisading, as if to increase the confusion.
Adams noticed that the young girls and women were of
all the terrified crowd seemingly the most terrified. He
did not know the reason; he could not even guess it. A
good man himself, and believing in a God in heaven, he
could not guess the truth. He knew nothing of the reason
of these women&#8217;s terror, and he looked with disgust
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
at the scene before him, not entirely comprehending.
Those creatures, so filthy, so animal-like, created in his
mind such abhorrence that he forgot to make allowances
for the fact that they were penned like swine, and
that perchance in their own native state, free in their own
villages, they might be cleaner and less revolting. He
could not hear the dismal cry of the &#8220;Congo niggers,&#8221;
who of all people on the earth are the most miserable, the
most abused, the most sorrow-stricken, the most dumb.
He did not know that he was looking at one of the filthy
acts in the great drama that a hundred years hence will
be read with horror by a more enlightened world.</p>
<p>They turned from the degrading sight and went back
to Verhaeren&#8217;s house for dinner.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE VOICE OF THE CONGO FOREST</h3>
</div>

<p>Just after daybreak next morning the expedition
started.</p>
<p>Berselius, Adams, the gun-bearers and Félix
headed the line; a long way after came the porters and
their loads, shepherded by half a dozen soldiers of the
state specially hired for the business.</p>
<p>Before they had gone a mile on their route the sun
was blazing strongly, sharp bird-calls came from the
trees, and from the porters tramping under their loads
a hum like the hum of an awakened beehive. These
people will talk and chatter when the sun rises; club them,
or threaten them, or load them with burdens as much
as you please, the old instinct of the birds and beasts
remains.</p>
<p>At first the way led through cassava and manioc fields
and past clumps of palms; then, all at once, and like
plunging under a green veil or into the heart of a green
wave, they entered the forest.</p>
<p>The night chill was just leaving the forest, the great
green gloom, festooned with fantastic rope-like tendrils,
was drinking the sunlight with a million tongues;
you could hear the rustle and snap of branches straightening
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
themselves and sighing toward heaven after the
long, damp, chilly night. The tropical forest at daybreak
flings its arms up to the sun as if to embrace him,
and all the teeming life it holds gives tongue. Flights of
coloured and extraordinary birds rise like smoke wreaths
from the steaming leaves, and the drone of a million,
million insects from the sonorous depths comes like the
sound of life in ferment.</p>
<p>The river lay a few miles to their left, and faintly
from it, muffled by the trees, they could hear the shrill
whistling of the river steamboat. It was like the &#8220;good-bye&#8221;
of civilization.</p>
<p>The road they were pursuing through the forest was
just a dim track beaten down by the feet of the copal
and cassava gatherers bearing their loads to Yandjali.
Here and there the forest thinned out and a riot of
umbrella thorns, vicious, sword-like grass and tall,
dull purple flowers, like hollyhocks made a scrub that
choked the way and tangled the foot; then the trees
would thicken up, and with the green gloom of a
mighty wave the forest would fall upon the travellers
and swallow them up.</p>
<p>Adams, tramping beside Berselius, tried vainly to
analyze the extraordinary and new sensations to which
this place gave birth in him.</p>
<p>The forest had taken him. It seemed to him, on
entering it, that he had died to all the things he had
ever known. At Yandjali he had felt himself in a foreign
country, but still in touch with Europe and the past;
a mile deep in the forest and Yandjali itself, savage as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
it was, seemed part of the civilization and the life he had
left behind him.</p>
<p>The forests of the old world may be vast, but their trees
are familiar. One may lose one&#8217;s direction, but one can
never lose <i>oneself</i> amidst the friendly pines, the beeches, the
oaks, whose forms have been known to us from childhood.</p>
<p>But here, where the beard-moss hangs from unknown
trees, as we tramp through the sweltering sap-scented
gloom, we feel ourselves not in a forest but under a cover.</p>
<p>There is nothing of the perfume of the pine, nothing
of the breeze in the branches, nothing of the beauty of
the forest twilight here. We are in a great green room,
festooned with vines and tendrils and hung about with
leaves. Nothing is beautiful here, but everything is
curious. It is a curiosity shop, where one pays with
the sweat of one&#8217;s brow, with the languor of one&#8217;s body,
and the remembrance of one&#8217;s past, for the sight of an
orchid shaped like a bird, or a flower shaped like a jug,
or a bird whose flight is a flash of sapphire dust.</p>
<p>A great green room, where echo sounds of things
unknown.</p>
<p>You can see nothing but the foliage, and the tree boles
just around, yet the place is full of life and war and danger.</p>
<p>That crash followed by the shrieking of birds&mdash;you
cannot tell whether it is half a mile away or quite close, or
to the right, or to the left, or whether it is caused by a
branch torn from a tree by some huge hand, or a tree
a hundred years old felled at last by Time.</p>
<p>Time is the woodman of the Congo forests. Nobody
else could do the work, and he works in his own lazy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
fashion, leaving things to right themselves and find their
own salvation.</p>
<p>Just as there is eternal war to the death between the
beasts of this jungle, so there is war to the death between
the trees, the vines, and the weeds. A frightful battle
between the vegetable things is going on; we scarcely
recognize it, because the processes are so slow, but if
five years of the jungle could be photographed week by
week, and the whole series be run rapidly off on some
huge cinematograph machine, you would see a heaving
and rending struggle for existence, vegetation fed by the
roaring tropical rains rising like a giant and flinging
itself on the vegetation of yesterday; vines lengthening
like snakes, tree felling tree, and weed choking weed.</p>
<p>Even in the quietude of a moment, standing and
looking before one at the moss-bearded trees and the
python-like loops of the lianas, one can see the struggle
crystallized, just as in the still marble of the Laocoon one
sees the struggle of life with death.</p>
<p>In this place which covers an unthinkable area of
the earth, a vast population has dwelt since the beginning
of time. Think of it. Shut off from the world
which has progressed toward civilization, alone with
the beasts and the trees, they have lived here without a
guide and without a God. The instinct which teaches
the birds to build nests taught them to build huts; the
herd-instinct drove them into tribes.</p>
<p>Then, ages ago, before Christ was crucified, before
Moses was born, began the terrible and pathetic attempt
of a predamned people to raise their heads and walk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
erect. The first lifting of purblind eyes destined never
to see even the face of Art.</p>
<p>Yet there was a germ of civilization amongst them.
They had villages and vague laws and art of a sort;
the ferocious tribes drew to one side, hunting beasts
and warring with each other, and the others, the milder
and kindlier tribes, led their own comparatively quiet
life; and Mohammed was born somewhere in the unknown
North, and they knew nothing of the fact till the Arab
slavers raided them, and robbed them of men and women
and children, just as boys rob an orchard.</p>
<p>But the birth of Christ and the foundation of Christendom
was the event which in far distant years was
destined to be this unhappy people&#8217;s last undoing.</p>
<p>They had known the beasts of the forests, the storms,
the rains, the Arab raiders, but Fate had reserved a new
thing for them to know. The Christians. Alas! that
one should have to say it, but here the fact is, that white
men, Christian men, have taken these people, have drawn
under the banner of Christianity and under Christian
pay all the warlike tribes, armed them, and set them as
task-masters over the humble and meek. And never
in the history of the world has such a state of servitude
been known as at present exists in the country of this
forlorn people.</p>
<p>They had been marching some three hours when,
from ahead came a sound as of some huge animal approaching.
Berselius half turned to his gun-bearer for his rifle,
but Félix reassured him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cassava bearers,&#8221; said Félix.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></p>
<p>It was, in fact, a crowd of natives; some thirty or
forty, bearing loads of Kwanga (cassava cakes) to Yandjali.
They were coming along the forest path in single
file, their burdens on their heads, and when the leaders
saw the white men they stopped dead. A great chattering
broke out. One could hear it going back all
along the unseen line, a rattlesnake of sound. Then
Félix called out to them; the gun-bearers and the
white men stood aside, and the cassava bearers, taking
heart, advanced.</p>
<p>They were heavily laden, for most of them had from
ten to twenty Kwanga on their heads, and besides this
burden&mdash;they were mostly women&mdash;several of them
had babies slung on their backs.</p>
<p>These people belonged to a village which lay within
Verhaeren&#8217;s district. The tax laid on this village was
three hundred cakes of cassava to be delivered at Yandjali
every eight days.</p>
<p>The people of this village were a lazy lot, and if you
have ever collected taxes in England, you can fancy the
trouble of making such people&mdash;savages living in a
tropical forest, who have no count of time and scarcely
an idea of numbers&mdash;pay up.</p>
<p>Especially when one takes into consideration the fact
that to produce three hundred cakes of cassava every
eight days, the whole village must work literally like a
beehive, the men gathering and the women grinding the
stuff from dawn till dark.</p>
<p>Only by the heaviest penalties could such a desirable
state of things be brought about, and the heavier
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
and sharper the punishments inflicted at any one time,
the easier was it for Verhaeren to work these people.</p>
<p>Adams watched the cassava bearers as they passed
at a trot. They went by like automatic figures, without
raising their eyes from the ground. There were some
old women amongst them who looked more like shrivelled
monkeys than human beings; extraordinary anatomical
specimens, whose muscles, working as they ran, were as
visible as though no skin covered them. There were
young women, young children, and women far advanced
in pregnancy; and they all went by like automatic figures,
clockwork marionettes.</p>
<p>It was a pitiable spectacle enough, these laden creatures,
mute looking as dumb beasts; but there was nothing
especially to shock the eye of the European, for it is the
long-prepared treason against this people, devised and
carried out by nature, that their black mask covers a
multitude of other people&#8217;s sins and their own untold
sufferings.</p>
<p>Had they been white, the despairing look, the sunken
eyes, the hundred signs that tell of suffering and slavery
would have been visible, would have appealed to the heart;
but the black mass could not express these things fully.
They were niggers, uglier looking and more depressed
looking than other niggers&mdash;that was all.</p>
<p>And so Adams passed on, without knowing what he
had seen and the only impression the sight made on his
mind was one of disgust.</p>
<p>One fact his professional eye noticed as the crowd
passed by. Four of the women had lost their left hands.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>The hands had been amputated just above the wrist
in three cases, and one woman had suffered amputation
at the middle of the forearm.</p>
<p>He spoke of this to Berselius, who did not seem to hear
his remark.</p>
<p>At noon they halted for a three hours&#8217; rest, and then
pushed on, camping for the night, after a twenty-five
miles&#8217; journey, in a break of the forest.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>BIG GAME</h3>
</div>

<p>Just as going along the coast by Pondoland one
sees English park scenery running down to the
very sea edge, so the Congo has its surprises in
strips of country that might, as far as appearance goes,
have been cut out of Europe and planted here.</p>
<p>This glade which Félix had chosen for a camping
place was strewn with rough grass and studded here and
there with what at first sight seemed apple trees: they
were in reality thorns.</p>
<p>The camp was pitched and the fires lit on the edge
of the forest, and then Berselius proceeded to take tale
of his people and found one missing. One of the cook
boys had dropped behind and vanished. He had been
lame shortly after the start. The soldiers had not seen
him drop behind, but the porters had.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many miles away was it?&#8221; asked Berselius
of the collected porters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nkoto, nkoto (Very many, very many),&#8221; the answer
came in a chorus, for a group of savages, if they have
the same idea in common, will all shout together in
response to an answer, like one man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why had they not told?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We did not know,&#8221; came the irrelevant answer in
chorus.</p>
<p>Berselius knew quite well that they had not told
simply from heedlessness and want of initiative. He would
have flogged the whole lot soundly, but he wanted them
fresh for the morrow&#8217;s work. Cutting down their rations
would but weaken them, and as for threatening to dock
their pay, such a threat has no effect on a savage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; said Berselius.</p>
<p>He had just dismissed the porters with a reprimand
when his keen eye caught sight of something far up the
glade. It wanted an hour of sunset.</p>
<p>Adams, following the direction in which Berselius
was gazing, saw, a great distance off, to judge by the
diminishing size of the thorn trees, a form that made
his heart to leap in him.</p>
<p>Massive and motionless, a great creature stood humped
in the level light; the twin horns back-curving and silhouetted
against the sky told him at once what it was.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bull rhinoceros,&#8221; said Berselius. &#8220;Been lying up
in the thick stuff all day; come out to feed.&#8221; He made
a sign to Félix who, knowing exactly what was wanted,
dived into the tent and came back with a .400 cordite
rifle and Adams&#8217;s elephant gun.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; said Berselius, &#8220;the brute is evidently thinking.
They stay like that for an hour sometimes. If
we have any luck, we may get a shot sideways before he
moves. There&#8217;s not a breath of wind.&#8221;</p>
<p>They started, Félix following with the guns.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would not bother about him,&#8221; said Berselius,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
&#8220;only the meat will be useful, and it will be an experience
for you. You will take first shot, and, if he charges, aim
just behind the shoulder&mdash;that&#8217;s the spot for a rhino if
you can reach it; for other animals aim at the neck, no
matter what animal it is, or whether it is a lion or a
buck; the neck shot is the knock-out blow. I have seen
a lion shot through the heart travel fifty yards and
kill a man; had he been struck in the neck he would
have fallen in his tracks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cow,&#8221; said Félix from behind.</p>
<p>Out of the thick stuff on the edge of the forest another
form had broken. She was scarcely smaller than the
bull, but the horns were shorter; she was paler in colour,
too, and showed up not nearly so well. Then she vanished
into the thick stuff, but the bull remained standing,
immovable as though he were made of cast iron, and the
two awful horns, now more distinct, cut the background
like scimitars.</p>
<p>The rhinoceros, like the aboriginal native of the Congo,
has come straight down from pre-Adamite days almost
without change. He is half blind now; he can scarcely
see twenty yards, he is still moving in the night of the
ancient world, and the smell of a man excites the wildest
apprehension in his vestige of a mind. He scents you,
flings his heavy head from side to side, and then to all
appearances he charges you.</p>
<p>Nothing could appear more wicked, ferocious, and
full of deadly intent than this charge; yet, in reality, the
unfortunate brute is not seeking you at all, but running
away from you; for the rhino when running away always
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
runs in the direction from which the wind is blowing.
You are in that direction, else your scent could not reach
him; as your scent grows stronger and stronger, the more
alarmed does he become and the quicker he runs. Now
he sights you, or you fire. If you miss, God help you,
for he charges the flash with all his fright suddenly
changed to fury.</p>
<p>They had got within four hundred yards from the
brute when a faint puff of wind stirred the grass, and
instantly the rhino shifted his position.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got our scent,&#8221; said Berselius, taking the cordite
rifle from Félix, who handed his gun also to Adams.
&#8220;He&#8217;s got it strong. We will wait for him here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rhino, after a few uneasy movements, began to
&#8220;run about.&#8221; One could see that the brute was ill at
ease; he went in a half-circle, and then, the wind increasing,
and bringing the scent strong, he headed straight
for Berselius and his companions, and charged.</p>
<p>The sound of him coming was like the sound of a great
drum beaten by a lunatic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t fire till I give the word,&#8221; cried Berselius,
&#8220;and aim just behind the shoulder.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adams, who was to the left of the charging beast,
raised the rifle and looked down the sights. He knew
that if he missed, the brute would charge the flash and
be on him perhaps before he could give it the second
barrel.</p>
<p>It was exactly like standing before an advancing
express engine. An engine, moreover, that had the power
of leaving the metals to chase you should you not derail it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>Would Berselius never speak! Berselius all the time
was glancing from the rhino to Adams.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fire!&#8221;</p>
<p>The ear-blasting report of the elephant gun echoed
from the forest, and the rhino, just as if he had been tripped
by an invisible wire fence, fell, tearing up the ground and
squealing like a pig.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Berselius.</p>
<p>Adams wiped the sweat from his forehead with the
back of his hand. He had never gone through a moment
of more deadly nerve tension.</p>
<p>He was moving toward his quarry, now stretched
stiff and stark, when he was arrested by Félix.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cow,&#8221; said Félix again.</p>
<p>The cow had broken cover at the report of the gun
and had got their wind.</p>
<p>Just as two automatic figures of the same make will,
when wound up, and touched off, perform the same
actions, the cow did exactly what the bull had done&mdash;ran
about in a fierce and distressed manner and then
charged right in the eye of the wind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mine,&#8221; said Berselius, and he went forward twenty
paces to meet her.</p>
<p>Berselius, chilling and aloof to the point of mysteriousness,
had, since the very starting of the expedition, shown
little of his true character to his companion. What he
had shown up to this had not lowered Adams&#8217;s respect
for him.</p>
<p>Self-restraint seemed the mainspring of that commanding
force which this strange man exercised. His
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
reprimand to the porters for the loss of the boy, expressed
in a few quiet words, had sent them shivering to their
places, cowed and dumb. Animal instinct seemed to tell
them of a terrible animal which the self-restraint of that
quiet-looking little man, with the pointed beard, alone
prevented from breaking upon them.</p>
<p>Berselius had allowed the bull to approach to a little
over a hundred yards before letting Adams fire. He
had gauged the American&#8217;s nerve to a nicety and his
power of self-restraint, and he knew that beyond the
hundred-yard limit he dared not trust them; for no man
born of woman who has not had a good experience of
big game can stand up to a charging rhinoceros and
take certain aim when the hundred-yard limit has
been passed.</p>
<p>The thunderous drumming of the oncoming brute
echoed from the forest. Had its head been a feather-pillow
the impact of the three tons of solid flesh moving
behind it would have been certain death; but the
head was an instrument of destruction, devised when the
megatherium walked the world, and the long raking horn
would have ripped up an elephant as easily as a sharp
penknife rips up a rabbit.</p>
<p>Before this thing, and to the right of it, rifle in
hand, stood Berselius. He did not even lift the gun
to his shoulder till the hundred-yard limit was
passed, and then he hung on his aim so horribly that
Adams felt the sweat-drops running on his face like
ants, and even Félix swallowed like a man who is
trying to choke down something nauseous. It was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
magnificent exhibition of daring and self-restraint and
cool assurance.</p>
<p>At twenty-five yards or a little under, the cordite rang
out. The brute seemed to trip, just as the other had done,
over some invisible taut-stretched wire, and skidding with
its own impetus, squealing, striking out and tearing up
the grass, it came right up to Berselius&#8217;s feet before stiffening
in death. Like the great automaton it was, it had
scented the human beings just as the bull had scented
them, &#8220;fussed&#8221; just as he had fussed, charged as he had
charged, and died as he had died.</p>
<p>And now from the camp rose a great outcry, &#8220;Nyama,
nyama! (Meat, meat!).&#8221; From the soldiers, from the
gun-bearers, from the porters it came. There were no
longer soldiers, or gun-bearers, or porters; every distinction
was forgotten; they were all savages, voicing
the eternal cry of the jungle, &#8220;Nyama, nyama! (Meat,
meat!).&#8221;</p>
<p>In the last rays of the sunset the two gigantic forms
lay stretched forever in death. They lay as they had
composed themselves after that long stiff stretch which
every animal takes before settling itself for eternal sleep;
and Adams stood looking at the great grinning masks
tipped with the murderous horns, whilst Berselius, with
his gun butt resting on his boot, stood watching with a
brooding eye as the porters and gun-bearers swarmed like
ants around the slain animals and proceeded, under his
direction, to cut them up. Then the meat was brought
into camp. The tails and the best parts of the carcasses,
including the kidneys, were reserved for the white men,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
and the rations from the rest of the meat were served
out; but a dozen porters who had been last in the line,
and who were accountable for letting the boy drop behind,
got nothing.</p>
<p>It was pitiable to see their faces. But they deserved
their punishment, notwithstanding the fact that in the
middle of the meat distribution the missing boy limped
into camp. He had a thorn half an inch long in his foot,
which Adams extracted. Then the camp went to bed.</p>
<p>Adams in his tent under the mosquito net slept soundly
and heard and knew nothing of the incidents of the night.
Berselius was also sleeping soundly when, at about one
o&#8217;clock in the morning, Félix aroused him.</p>
<p>One of the porters had been caught stealing some
of the meat left over from the distribution of the night
before.</p>
<p>The extraordinary thing was that he had fed well,
not being one of the proscribed. He had stolen from
pure greed.</p>
<p>He was an undersized man, a weakling, and likely
to break down and give trouble anyway. His crime
was great.</p>
<p>Berselius sent Félix to his tent for a Mauser pistol.
Then the body was flung into the forest where the
roaring, rasping cry of a leopard was splitting the dark.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>M&#8217;BASSA</h3>
</div>

<p>Seven days&#8217; march took them one hundred and
twenty miles east of Yandjali and into the heart
of the great rubber district of M&#8217;Bonga.</p>
<p>Twenty miles a day ought to have been covered on an
average, but they had delayed here and there to shoot,
and the extra porters, whose duty it was to carry the
trophies, were already in requisition.</p>
<p>It had been forest most of the way, but forest broken
by open spaces; they had crossed two great swards of
park-like country where the antelope herds moved like
clouds, marvellous natural preserves that might have
been English but for the tropic haze and heat and the
great n&#8217;sambya trees with their yellow bell-like blossoms,
the m&#8217;binas with their bursts of scarlet bloom, the tall
feather-palms, and the wild papaws of the adjoining
woods.</p>
<p>But in the last two days of the march the forest had
thickened and taken a more sombre note; nothing they
had come upon heretofore had been quite so wild as this,
so luxuriant and tropical. It was the haunt of the rubber
vine, that mysterious plant which requires a glass-house
atmosphere and a soil especially rich. The great rubber
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
forest of M&#8217;Bonga, thousands of square miles in extent,
is really composed of two forests joined by an isthmus
of woods. Dimly, it is shaped like an hourglass; south
of the constriction where the two forests join lies the
elephant country for which Berselius was making, and
Félix had led them so craftily and well, that they struck
into the rubber district only fifty miles from the
constriction.</p>
<p>In the forest, thirty miles from the elephant ground,
lies the Belgian fort M&#8217;Bassa. They were making for
this place now, which was to be the base from which
they would start on the great hunt.</p>
<p>The fort of M&#8217;Bassa is not used to-day as a fort, only
as a collecting-place for rubber. In the early days it
was a very necessary entrenchment for the Belgians, as
a tribe almost as warlike as the Zappo Zaps terrorized
the districts; but the people of this tribe have long been
brought under the blue flag with the white star. They
are now &#8220;soldiers,&#8221; and their savagery, like a keen tool,
has been turned to good account by the Government.</p>
<p>In the great forest of M&#8217;Bonga the rubber vines are not
equally distributed. Large areas occur in which they
are not found; only in the most desolate places do they
grow. You cannot tame and prune and bring the rubber
vine into subjection; it will have nothing to do with the
vineyard and the field; it chooses to grow alone.</p>
<p>Everything else comes to its harvest with a joyous face,
but the rubber vine, like a dark green snake, fearful of
death, has to be hunted for.</p>
<p>Even in the areas of the forest which it frequents,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
it is only to be found in patches, so the harvesters cannot
go in a body, as men do to the harvesting of the corn, or
the cotton, or the grape; they have to break up into small
parties and these again subdivide, leaving a single individual
here and there where the vines are thickest. He,
entirely alone, at the mercy of the evil spirits that are in
his imagination and the beasts that are in the forest,
makes a rude shelter out of boughs and leaves, and sets
to work making incisions in the vine and draining them
drop by drop of their viscous sap.</p>
<p>Sometimes he sings over this monotonous work, and
in the long rains between the intervals of the shower-bath
roarings you can hear the ululations of these folk
through the drip of the leaves, and at night the spark-like
glimmer of their fires dots the reeking gloom.</p>
<p>These are the conditions of the rubber collector&#8217;s
task, and it is not a task that ever can be finished; year
in, year out, it never ceases.</p>
<p>These woods through which Félix led them were to
the woods near Yandjali what the music of Beethoven
is to the music of Mozart.</p>
<p>Immense and gloomy symphonies. The trees were
huge, and groaned beneath the weight of lianas cable-thick.
At times they had to burst their way through
the veils of leaves and vines, the porters losing themselves
and calling one to the other, and the head of the expedition
halting till the stragglers were collected; at times the
ground they trod on was like grease from the cast-down
fruit of the plantains that grew here enormous, and sodden,
and dismal, showering their fruit in such quantities
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
that the bush-pigs, devour as they might, could never
dispose of it all.</p>
<p>On some of the trees, like huge withered leaves, hung
bats, and from some of the trees the beard-moss hung
yards long, and of a spectral gray; the very weeds trodden
underfoot were sappy, and the smell of their squirting
juice mixed itself with the smell of decay.</p>
<p>It was not even ground, either; the whole forest would
dip down into an unseen valley; you felt yourself going
down hill, down, down, and then you knew you were at
the bottom of a sub-arboreal valley by the deeper stagnation
of the air. Open spaces, when they came, showed
little sky, and they were less open spaces than rooms in
the surrounding prison.</p>
<p>Félix was not leading them through the uttermost
depths of this place; he was following the vague indications
of a road by which the rubber from M&#8217;Bassa was
carted to the river.</p>
<p>They were travelling along a highway, in fact, and the
dimmest indication of a track where other men have been
before is a thing which robs the wilderness of much of
its terror.</p>
<p>The loneliness of the forest beyond track or way, in
those vast depths where the rubber collectors have to go
alone, I leave you to imagine.</p>
<p>At last, at noon, on the third day of their journey to
this place they struck rising ground where the trees fell
away till no trees were left, and the blue sky of heaven
lay above their heads, and before them on the highest
point of the rise, Fort M&#8217;Bassa burning in the sun.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>ANDREAS MEEUS</h3>
</div>

<p>The Parthenon in all its glory could not have
looked more beautiful to the returning Greek than
this half-ruined fort in the eyes of Adams.</p>
<p>A thing built by the hands of white men and shone
on by the sun&mdash;what could be more acceptable to the
eye after the long, long tramp through the heart-breaking
forest!</p>
<p>The fort of M&#8217;Bassa was quite small; the surrounding
walls had gone to decay, but the &#8220;guest house&#8221; and the
office, and the great go-down where the rubber was
stored, were in good repair and well thatched.</p>
<p>Outside the walls were a number of wretched hovels
inhabited by the &#8220;soldiers&#8221; and their wives, and one
of these soldiers, a tall black, with the eternal red fez
on his head and a rifle slung on his back, was the first to
sight the coming expedition, and to notify its approach
with a yell that brought a dozen like him from the sun-baked
hovels and, a moment later from the office, a white
man in a pith helmet, who stood for a moment looking
across the half-ruined wall at the newcomers, and then
advanced to meet them.</p>
<p>He was a middle-sized man, with a melancholy face
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
that showed very white under the shadow of the helmet;
he was dressed in dingy white drill, and he had a cigarette
between his lips.</p>
<p>He looked like a man who had never in his life smiled,
yet his face was not an unpleasant face altogether, though
there was much in it to give the observer pause.</p>
<p>His voice was not an unpleasant voice, altogether, yet
there was that in it, as he greeted Berselius, which struck
Adams sharply and strangely; for the voice of Andreas
Meeus, <i>Chef de Poste</i> at M&#8217;Bassa, was the voice of a
man who for two years had been condemned to talk the
language of the natives. It had curious inflections,
hesitancies, and a dulness that expressed the condition
of a brain condemned for two years to think the thoughts
of the natives in their own language.</p>
<p>Just as the voice of a violin expresses the condition
of the violin, so does the voice of a man express the condition
of his mind. And that is the fact that will strike
you most if you travel in the wilds of the Congo State and
talk to the men of your own colour who are condemned
to live amongst the people.</p>
<p>One might have compared Meeus&#8217;s voice to the voice of
a violin&mdash;a violin that had been attacked by some strange
fungoid growth that had filled its interior and dulled
the sounding board.</p>
<p>He had been apprised a month before of the coming
of Berselius&#8217;s expedition, and one might imagine the servility
which this man would show to the all-powerful Berselius,
whose hunting expeditions were red-carpeted, who
was hail-fellow-well-met with Leopold, who, by lifting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
his finger, could cause Andreas Meeus to be dismissed
from his post, and by crooking his finger cause him to be
raised to a Commissionership.</p>
<p>Yet he showed no servility at all. He had left servility
behind him, just as he had left pride, just as he had left
ambition, patriotism, country, and that divine something
which blossoms into love of wife and child.</p>
<p>When he had shaken hands with Berselius and Adams,
he led the way into the fort, or rather into the enclosure
surrounded by the ruinous mud walls, an enclosure of
about a hundred yards square.</p>
<p>On the right of the quadrangle stood the go-down,
where the rubber and a small quantity of ivory was stored.</p>
<p>In the centre stood the misnamed guest house, a
large mud and wattle building, with a veranda gone
to decay.</p>
<p>The blinding sun shone on it all, showing up with its
fierce light the true and appalling desolation of the place.
There was not one thing in the enclosure upon which
the eye could rest with thankfulness.</p>
<p>Turning from the enclosure and looking across the
fort wall to the distance, one saw a world as far from
civilization as the world that Romulus looked at when he
gazed across the wall outlining the first dim sketch of
Rome.</p>
<p>To the north, forest; to the south, forest; to the east,
forest; and to the west, eternal and illimitable forest.
Blazing sun, everlasting haze that in the rainy season
would become mist and silence.</p>
<p>In the storms and under the rains the great rubber
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
forest of M&#8217;Bonga would roar like a reef-tormented sea,
but on a day like this, when, gazing from the high ground
of the fort, the eye travelled across the swelling domes
and heat-stricken valleys of foliage, the pale green of the
feather-palms, the sombre green of the n&#8217;sambyas, to the
haze that veiled all things beyond, on a day like this,
silence gazed at one Sphinx-like, and from the distance
of a million years. Silence that had brooded upon Africa
before Africa had a name, before Pharaoh was born,
before Thebes was built.</p>
<p>Meeus led the way into the guest house, which contained
only two rooms&mdash;rooms spacious enough, but
bare of everything except the ordinary necessities of life.
In the living room there was a table of white deal-like
wood and three or four chairs evidently made by natives
from a European design. A leopard skin, badly dried and
shrivelling at the edges, hung on one wall, presumably as
an ornament; on another wall some Congo bows and
arrows&mdash;bows with enormously thick strings and
arrows poisoned so skilfully that a scratch from one would
kill you, though they had been hanging there for many
years. They were trophies of the early days when Fort
M&#8217;Bassa was really a fort, and from those woods down
there clouds of soot-black devils, with filed teeth, raided
the place, only to be swept away by rifle fire.</p>
<p>There was no picture torn from an illustrated paper
adorning the place, as in Verhaeren&#8217;s abode, but on a
rudely constructed shelf there lay just the same stack of
&#8220;official letters,&#8221; some of these two years old, some of
last month, all dealing with trade.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>Meeus brought out cigarettes and gin, but Berselius,
safe now at his base of operations, to make a little festival
of the occasion sent to the stores, which his porters had
deposited in the go-down, for a magnum of champagne.
It was Cliquot, and as Meeus felt the glow of the wine in
his veins, a flush came into his hollow cheeks and a brightness
into his dull eyes; forgotten things stirred again in
his memory, with the shadows of people he had known&mdash;the
glitter of lamplit streets in Brussels, the glare of the
<i>Café de Couronne</i>&mdash;all the past, such as it was, lay in
the wine.</p>
<p>Meeus was one of the &#8220;unfortunate men.&#8221; He had
held a small clerkship under the Belgian Government,
from which he had been dismissed through a fault of
his own.</p>
<p>This was five years ago. Up to his dismissal he had
led the peddling and sordid life that a small government
clerk on the Continent leads if he has nothing to save him
from himself and from his fellows: the dry rot of official
life had left him useless for anything but official life. A
sensualist in a small way, he enlarged his sphere on the
day of his dismissal, when he found himself cut off from
work and adrift in the world, with five hundred francs in
his pocket. In one glorious debauch, which lasted a week,
he spent the five hundred francs, and then he settled down
to live on a maiden aunt.</p>
<p>He called it looking for work.</p>
<p>She lasted for a year and nine months, and then
she died, and her annuity died with her. He felt her
loss deeply, for not only had her money helped to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
support him, but she was his only real friend, and he
had a heart in those days that seemed so far distant
from him now.</p>
<p>Then it was that Poverty took him by the hand and
explained patiently and with diagrams the hardness of
the world, the atrocious position of the <i>déclassé</i>, who has
never studied the art of roguery so as to make a living by
it, and the utter uselessness as friends of those good
fellows who sat in the <i>cafés</i> and walked the boulevards
and ogled the women.</p>
<p>He tramped the streets of Brussels, at first in seedy
clothes and at last in filth and horrible rags. A relative
came to his assistance with two hundred francs; he
bought himself clothes and made himself respectable,
but, in a fortnight, found himself relapsing again, sinking
like a swimmer whose momentary support has gone to
pieces.</p>
<p>Just as the waves were again about to close over his
benighted head, an acquaintance got him a post under
Government. Not under the Belgian but the Congo
Government.</p>
<p>Andreas Meeus was exactly the type of man this
Government required, and still requires, and still uses
and must continue to use as long as the infernal machine
which it has invented for the extraction of gold from
niggers continues to work. A man, that is to say, who
has eaten orange-peel picked up in the market-place;
a man who has worn out his friends&mdash;and his clothes.
A man without hope.</p>
<p>One would think for the work in hand they would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
choose the greatest blackguards possible: convicts convicted
of the worst crimes of violence. Not at all. These
men would be for one thing too intractable; for another
thing, too unstable, and for another thing (strange to say),
possessed of too much heart. The Congo Government
knows its work far too well for that. It does not take the
murderer or the violent criminal from the penitentiary
to do its work; it takes from the streets the man without
hope. The educated man who has fallen, the man who
can still think.</p>
<p>Meeus went to Africa just as a man goes to prison.
He hated the idea of going, but he had to go, or stay and
starve. He was stationed three months at Boma and
then he was moved to a post on the Upper Congo, a small
and easily worked post, where he found out the full conditions
of his new servitude.</p>
<p>This post had to do with what they call in the jargon
of the Congo administration, Forest Exploitation. Gum
copal and wax was the stuff he had to extract from the
people round about.</p>
<p>Here he found himself morally in the clutches of that
famous and infamous proclamation issued from Brussels
on the twentieth of June, 1892, by Secretary of State
Van Estvelde.</p>
<p>The Bonus Proclamation.</p>
<p>According to the terms of this proclamation, Meeus
found that besides his pay he could get a bonus on every
kilo of wax and copal he could extract from the natives,
and that the cheaper he could get the stuff the more his
bonus would be.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></p>
<p>Thus, for every kilo of wax or copal screwed out of the
natives at a cost of five centimes or less, he received into
his pocket a bonus of fifteen centimes, that is to say the
bonus to Meeus was three times what the natives got; if
by any laxity or sense of justice, the cost of the wax or
copal rose to six centimes a kilo, Meeus only got ten centimes
bonus, and so on.</p>
<p>The cheaper he got the stuff the more he was paid
for it. And those were the terms on which he had to trade
with the natives.</p>
<p>Then there were the taxes. The natives had to bring
in huge quantities of wax and copal for nothing, just as
a tax owing to the State, a tax to the Government that
was plundering and exploiting them.</p>
<p>Meeus, who had a spice of the tradesman in him, fell
into this state of things as easily as a billiard ball falls
into a pocket when skilfully directed.</p>
<p>The unfortunate man was absolutely a billiard ball
in the hands of a professional player; the stroke of the
cue had been given in Belgium, he rolled to his appointed
post, fell into it, and was damned.</p>
<p>His fingers became crooked and a dull hunger for
money filled his soul. His success in working the niggers
was so great that he was moved to a more difficult post
at higher pay, and then right on to M&#8217;Bassa.</p>
<p>He was not naturally a cruel man. In his childhood
he had been fond of animals, but Matabiche, the god-devil
of the Congo, changed all that.</p>
<p>He saw nothing extortionate in his dealings, nothing
wrong in them. When things were going well, then all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
was well; but when the natives resisted his charges and
taxes, defrauding him of his bonus and lowering him
in the eyes of his superiors, then Meeus became terrible.</p>
<p>And he was absolute master.</p>
<p>Away here in the lonely fort, in the midst of the great
M&#8217;Bonga rubber forest that was now speechless as a
Sphinx, now roaring at him like a sea in torment; here
in the endless sunlight of the dry seasons and the endless
misery of the rains, Meeus driven in upon himself, had
time to think.</p>
<p>There is no prison so terrible as a limitless prison.
Far better for a man to inhabit a cell in Dartmoor than a
post in the desert of the forest. The walls are companionable
things, but there is no companionship in distance.</p>
<p>Meeus knew what it was to look over the walls of the
fort and watch another sun setting on another day, and
another darkness heralding another night. He knew
what it was to watch infinite freedom and to know it for
his captor and jailer. He knew what it was to wake
from his noonday siesta and see the same great awful
splash of sunlight striking the same old space of arid yard,
where the empty tomato tin lay by the rotten plantain
cast over by some nigger child. He knew what it was to
lie and hear the flies buzzing and wonder what tune of the
devil it was they were trying to imitate. He knew what
it was to think of death with the impotent craving of a
sick child for some impossible toy.</p>
<p>Look into your own life and see all the tiny things that
save you from <i>ennui</i> and devilment, and give you heart to
continue the journey from hour to hour in this world
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
where we live. Your morning paper, the new book from
the library you have just got to read, the pipe you hope
to smoke when you return from work, the very details
of your work; a hundred and one petty things that make
up the day of an ordinary man, breaking the monotony
and breaking the prospect before him into short views.</p>
<p>Meeus had none of these. Without literature or love,
without a woman to help him through, without a child
to care for or a dog to care for him, there at Fort M&#8217;Bassa
in the glaring sunshine he faced his fate and became
what he was.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>NIGHT AT THE FORT</h3>
</div>

<p>The night was hot and close and the paraffin lamp
in the guest house mixed its smell with the
tobacco smoke and with a faint, faint musky
odour that came from the night outside. Every now and
then a puff of hot wind blew through the open doorway,
hot and damp as though a great panther were breathing
into the room.</p>
<p>The nights in the forest were chill, but up here at Fort
M&#8217;Bassa they were stewing in a heat wave.</p>
<p>Adams, with his coat off, pipe in mouth, was leaning
back in a basket chair with his feet on a sugar box.
Berselius, in another easy chair, was smoking a cigar,
and Meeus, sitting with his elbows on the table, was talking
of trade and its troubles. There is an evil spirit in
rubber that gives a lot of trouble to those who deal with
it. The getting of it is bad enough, but the tricks of the
thing itself are worse. It is subject to all sorts of
influences, climatic and other, and tends to deteriorate on
its journey to the river and the coast of Europe.</p>
<p>It was marvellous to see the passion with which this
man spoke of this inanimate thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then, ivory,&#8221; said Meeus. &#8220;When I came here
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
first, hundred-pound tusks were common; when you reach
that district, M. le Capitaine, you will see for yourself, no
doubt, that the elephants have decreased. What comes in
now, even, is not of the same quality. Scrivelloes (small
tusks), defective tusks, for which one gets almost nothing
as a bonus. And with the decrease of the elephant comes
the increased subterfuge of the natives. &#8216;What are we to
do?&#8217; they say. &#8216;We cannot make elephants.&#8217; This is
the worst six months for ivory I have had, and then, on
top of this&mdash;for troubles always come together&mdash;I have
this bother I told you of with these people down there by
the Silent Pools.&#8221;</p>
<p>A village ten miles to the east had, during the last few
weeks, suspended rubber payments, gone arrear in taxes,
the villagers running off into the forest and hiding from
their hateful work.</p>
<p>&#8220;What caused the trouble?&#8221; asked Berselius.</p>
<p>&#8220;God knows,&#8221; replied Meeus. &#8220;It may blow over&mdash;it
may have blown over by this, for I have had no word
for two days; anyhow, to-morrow I will walk over and
see. If it hasn&#8217;t blown over, I will give the people very
clearly to understand that there will be trouble. I will
stay there for a few days and see what persuasion can do.
Would you like to come with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; said Berselius. &#8220;A few days&#8217; rest
will do the porters no harm. What do you say, Dr.
Adams?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m with you,&#8221; said Adams. &#8220;Anything better than
to stay back here alone. How do you find it here, M.
Meeus, when you are by yourself?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, one lives,&#8221; replied the <i>Chef de Poste</i>, looking
at the cigarette between his fingers with a dreamy expression,
and speaking as though he were addressing it. &#8220;One
lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>That, thought Adams, must be the worst part about
it. But he did not speak the words. He was a silent
man, slow of speech but ready with sympathy, and as he
lounged comfortably in his chair, smoking his pipe, his
pity for Meeus was profound. The man had been for
two years in this benighted solitude; two years without
seeing a white face, except on the rare occasion of a District
Commissioner&#8217;s visit.</p>
<p>He ought to have been mad by this, thought Adams;
and he was a judge, for he had studied madness and its
causes.</p>
<p>But Meeus was not mad in the least particular. He
was coldly sane. Lust had saved his reason, the lust
inspired by Matabiche.</p>
<p>Berselius&#8217;s cook brought in some coffee, and when they
had talked long enough about the Congo trade in its
various branches, they went out and smoked their pipes,
leaning or sitting on the low wall of the fort.</p>
<p>The first quarter of the moon, low in the sky and looking
like a boat-shaped Japanese lantern, lay above the forest.
The forest, spectral-pale and misty, lay beneath the moon;
the heat was sweltering, and Adams could not keep the
palms of his hands dry, rub them with his pocket
handkerchief or on his knees as much as he would.</p>
<p>This is the heat that makes a man feel limp as a wet
rag; the heat that liquefies morals and manners and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
temper and nerve force, so that they run with the sweat
from the pores. Drink will not &#8220;bite&#8221; in this heat, and
a stiff glass of brandy affects the head almost as little as
a glass of water.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is over there,&#8221; said Meeus, pointing to the southeast,
&#8220;that we are going to-morrow to interview those
beasts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adams started at the intensity of loathing expressed
by Meeus in that sentence. He had spoken almost
angrily at rubber and tusks, but his languid, complaining
voice had held nothing like this before.</p>
<p>Those beasts! He hated them, and he would not
have been human had he not hated them. They were
his jailers in very truth, their work was his deliverance.</p>
<p>The revolt of this village would make him short of
rubber; probably it would bring a reprimand from his
superiors.</p>
<p>A great bat flitted by so close that the smell of it poisoned
the air, and from the forest, far away to the west, came the
ripping saw-like cry of a leopard on the prowl. Many
fierce things were hunting in the forest that night, but
nothing fiercer than Meeus, as he stood in the moonlight,
cigarette in mouth, staring across the misty forest in the
direction of the Silent Pools.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE POOLS OF SILENCE</h3>
</div>

<p>Next morning Berselius ordered Félix to have the
tents taken from the go-down and enough stores
for two days. Tents and stores would be carried
by the &#8220;soldiers&#8221; of the fort, who were to accompany
them on the expedition.</p>
<p>Adams noticed with surprise the childlike interest
Meeus took in the belongings of Berselius; the green
rot-proof tents, the latest invention of Europe, seemed
to appeal to him especially; the Roorkee chairs, the
folding baths, the mosquito nets of the latest pattern,
the cooking utensils of pure aluminum, filled his
simple mind with astonishment. His mind during
his sojourn at Fort M&#8217;Bassa had, in fact, grown childlike
in this particular; nothing but little things appealed
to him.</p>
<p>Whilst the expedition was getting ready Adams strolled
about outside the fort walls. The black &#8220;soldiers,&#8221;
who were to accompany them, were seated in the sun near
their hovels, some of them cleaning their rifles, others
smoking; but for their rifles and fez caps they might, with
a view of Carthage in the distance, have been taken for
the black legionaries of Hamilcar, ferocious mercenaries
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
without country or God, fierce as the music of the leopard-skin
drums that led them to battle.</p>
<p>Turning, he walked round the west wall till he came
to the wall on the north, which was higher than the others.
Here, against the north wall, was a sheltered cover like
an immense sty, indescribably filthy and evil-smelling;
about thirty rings were fastened to the wall, and from
each ring depended a big rusty chain ending in a collar.</p>
<p>It was the Hostage House of Fort M&#8217;Bassa. It was
empty now, but nearly always full, and it stood there
like a horrible voiceless witness.</p>
<p>A great disgust filled the mind of Adams; disgust
of the niggers who had evidently lately inhabited this
place, and disgust of the Belgians who had herded them
there. He felt there was something very wrong in the
state of Congo. The Hostage House of Yandjali had
started the impression; Meeus in some subtle way had
deepened it; and now this.</p>
<p>But he fully recognized what difficult people to deal
with niggers are. He felt that all this was slavery under
a thin disguise, this so-called taxation and &#8220;trade,&#8221; but
it was not his affair.</p>
<p>All work is slavery more or less pleasant. The doctor
is the slave of his patients, the shopkeeper of his clients.
These niggers were, no doubt, slaves of the Belgians,
but they were not bought and sold; they had to work, it
is true, but all men have to work. Besides, Berselius
had told him that the Belgians had stopped the liquor
traffic and stopped the Arab raiders. There was good
and bad on the side of the Belgians, and the niggers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
were niggers. So reasoned Adams, and with reason
enough, though from insufficient data.</p>
<p>At eight o&#8217;clock in the blazing sunshine, that even
then was oppressive, the expedition started. The white
men leading, Félix coming immediately behind, and
eleven of the soldiers, bearing the tents and stores for
two days, following after.</p>
<p>They plunged into the forest, taking a dim track,
which was the rubber track from the village of the Silent
Pools and from half a dozen other villages to the west.
The ground here was different from the ground they had
traversed in coming to the fort. This was boggy; here
and there the foot sank with a sough into the pulp of
morass and rotten leaves; the lianas were thinner and more
snaky, the greenery, if possible, greener, and the air close
and moist as the air of a steam-bath.</p>
<p>The forest of M&#8217;Bonga has great tracts of this boggy,
pestiferous land, dreadful sloughs of despond caverned
with foliage, and by some curse the rubber vines entrench
themselves with these. The naked rubber collectors,
shivering over their fires, are attacked by the rheumatism
and dysentery and fever that lie in these swamps; diseases
almost merciful, for the aches and pains they cause draw
the mind away from the wild beasts and devils and
phantoms that haunt the imagination of the rubber
slaves.</p>
<p>It took them three hours to do the ten miles, and then
at last the forest cleared away and fairyland appeared.</p>
<p>Here in the very depths of the hopeless jungle, as if
laid out and forgotten by some ancient god, lie the Silent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
Pools of Matabayo and the park-like lands that hold them.
Like a beautiful song in some tragic and gloomy opera,
a regret of the God who created the hopeless forest,
sheltered by the great n&#8217;sambya trees, they lie; pools of
shadowy and tranquil water, broken by reflections of
branches and mirroring speargrass ten feet high and fanlike
fern fronds.</p>
<p>All was motionless and silent as a stereoscopic picture;
the rocketing palms bursting into sprays of emerald
green, the n&#8217;sambyas with their trumpet-like yellow blossoms,
the fern fronds reduplicating themselves in the
water&#8217;s glass, all and each lent their motionless beauty
to the completion of the perfect picture.</p>
<p>In the old days, long ago, before the land was exploited
and the forest turned into a hunting ground for rubber,
the lovely head of the oryx would push aside the long green
blades of the speargrass; then, bending her lips to the
lips of the oryx gazing up at her from the water, she would
drink, shattering the reflection into a thousand ripples.
The water-buck came here in herds from the elephant
country away south, beyond the hour-glass-like constriction
which divided the great forest, and the tiny dik-dik,
smallest of all antelopes, came also to take its sip. But
all that is past. The rifle and the trap, at the instigation of
the devouring Government that eats rubber and antelope,
ivory and palm-oil, cassava and copal, has thinned out the
herds and driven them away. The &#8220;soldier&#8221; must be
fed. Even the humble bush pig of the forest knows
that fact.</p>
<p>It was four years since Berselius had hunted in this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
country, and even in that short time he found enormous
change. But he could not grumble. He was a shareholder
in the company, and in twenty industries depending
on it.</p>
<p>Close up to the forest, where the m&#8217;bina trees showed
their balls of scarlet blossom, lay the village they had come
to reason with. There were twenty-five or more low huts
of wattle and mud, roofed with leaves and grass. No one
was visible but an old woman, naked, all but for a slight
covering about the loins. She was on all fours, grinding
something between two stones, and as she sighted the party
she looked backward over her shoulder at them like a
frightened cat.</p>
<p>She cried out in a chattering voice, and from the huts
six others, naked as herself, came, stared at the whites,
and then, as if driven by the same impulse, and just like
rabbits, darted into the forest.</p>
<p>But Meeus had counted on this, and had detached
seven of his men to crawl round and post themselves
at the back of the huts amidst the trees.</p>
<p>A great hullaballoo broke out, and almost immediately
the soldiers appeared, driving the seven villagers before
them with their rifle-butts.</p>
<p>They were not hurting them, just pushing them along,
for this was, up to the present, not a punitive expedition
but a fatherly visitation to point out the evils of laziness
and insubordination, and to get, if possible, these poor
wretches to communicate with the disaffected ones and
make them return to their work.</p>
<p>Adams nearly laughed outright at the faces of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
villagers; black countenances drawn into all the contortions
of fright, but the contortions of their bodies were
more laughable still, as they came forward like naughty
children, driven by the soldiers, putting their hands out
behind to evade the prods of the gun-butts.</p>
<p>Berselius had ordered the tents to be raised on the
sunlit grass, for the edge of the forest, though shady,
was infested by clouds of tiny black midges&mdash;midges
whose bite was as bad, almost, as the bite of a mosquito.</p>
<p>Meeus spoke to the people in their own tongue, telling
them not to be afraid, and when the tents were erected
he and Berselius and Adams, sitting in the shelter of the
biggest tent, faced the seven villagers, all drawn up in a
row and backed by the eleven soldiers in their red fez caps.</p>
<p>The villagers, backed by the soldiers and fronted by
Meeus, formed a picture which was the whole Congo
administration in a nutshell. In a sentence, underscored
by the line of blood-red fezzes.</p>
<p>These seven undersized, downtrodden, hideously
frightened creatures, with eyeballs rolling and the marks
of old chain scars on their necks, were the representatives
of all the humble and meek tribes of the Congo,
the people who for thousands of years had lived a lowly
life, humble as the coneys of Scripture; people who had
cultivated the art of agriculture and had carried civilization
as far as their weak hands would carry it in that
benighted land. Literally the salt of that dark earth.
Very poor salt, it is true, but the best they could make
of themselves.</p>
<p>These eleven red-tipped devils, gun-butting the others
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
to make them stand erect and keep in line, were the
representatives of the warlike tribes who for thousands
of years had preyed on each other and made the land a
hell. Cannibals most of them, ferocious all of them,
heartless to a man.</p>
<p>Meeus was the white man who, urged by the black
lust of money, had armed and drilled and brought under
good pay all the warlike tribes of the Congo State and
set them as task-masters over the humble tribes.</p>
<p>By extension, Berselius and Adams were the nations
of Europe looking on, one fully knowing, the other not
quite comprehending the tragedy enacted before their
eyes.</p>
<p>I am not fond of parallels, but as these people have
ranged themselves thus before my eyes, I cannot help
pointing out the full meaning of the picture. A picture
which is photographically true.</p>
<p>There was a little pot-bellied boy amongst the villagers,
the old woman of the grindstone was holding him by the
hand; he, of all the crowd, did not look in the least frightened.
His eyeballs rolled, but they rolled in wonder.</p>
<p>The tent seemed to take his fancy immensely; then
the big Adams struck his taste, and he examined him
from tip to toe.</p>
<p>Adams, greatly taken with the blackamoor, puffed out
his cheeks, closed one eye, and instantly, as if at the blow
of a hatchet, the black face split, disclosing two white
rows of teeth, and then hid itself, rubbing a snub nose
against the old woman&#8217;s thigh.</p>
<p>But a rolling white eyeball reappeared in a moment,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
only to vanish again as Adams, this time, sucked in his
cheeks and worked his nose, making, under his sun hat,
a picture to delight and terrify the heart of any child.</p>
<p>All this was quite unobserved by the rest, and all this
time Meeus gravely and slowly was talking to the villagers
in a quiet voice. They were to send one of their
number into the forest to find the defaulters and urge
them to return. Then all would be well. That was the
gist of his discourse; and the wavering line of niggers
rolled their eyes and answered, &#8220;We hear, we hear,&#8221; all
together and like one person speaking, and they were
nearly tumbling down with fright, for they knew that all
would not be well, and that what the awful white man
with the pale, grave face said to them was lies, lies, lies&mdash;all
lies.</p>
<p>Besides the old woman and the child there were two
young girls, an old man, a boy of fifteen or so, with only
one foot, and a pregnant woman very near her time.</p>
<p>Adams had almost forgotten the nigger child when
a white eyeball gazing at him from between the old
woman&#8217;s legs recalled its existence.</p>
<p>He thought he had never seen a jollier animal of the
human tribe than that. The creature was so absolutely
human and full of fun that it was difficult to believe it
the progeny of these downtrodden, frightened looking
folk. And the strange thing was, it had all the tricks of
an English or American child.</p>
<p>The hiding and peeping business, the ready laugh followed
by bashfulness and self-effacement, the old unalterable
impudence, which is not least amidst the <i>prima
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
mobilia</i> of the childish mind. In another moment,
he felt, the thing would forget its respect and return
his grimaces, so he ignored it and fixed his attention on
Meeus and the trembling wretches he was addressing.</p>
<p>When the lecture was over they were dismissed, and
the boy with the amputated foot was sent off to the forest
to find the delinquents and bring them back. Till sunrise
on the following day was the term given him.</p>
<p>If the others did not begin to return by that time there
would be trouble.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>BEHIND THE MASK</h3>
</div>

<p>The Silent Pools and the woods around were the
haunts of innumerable birds. Rose-coloured
flamingoes and gorgeous ducks, birds arrayed
in all the jewellery of the tropics, birds not much bigger
than dragon-flies, and birds that looked like flying beetles.</p>
<p>When they had dined, Adams, leaving the others to
smoke and take their siesta, went off by the water&#8217;s edge
on a tour of the pools. They were three in number;
sheets of water blue and tranquil and well-named, for
surely in all the world nowhere else could such perfect
peace be found. Perhaps it was the shelter of the
forest protecting these windless sheets of water; perhaps
it was the nature of the foliage, so triumphantly
alive yet so motionless; perhaps beyond these some
more recondite reason influenced the mind and stirred
the imagination. Who knows? The spirit of the scene
was there. The spirit of deep and unalterable peace.
The peace of shadowy lagoons, the peace of the cedar
groves where the sheltering trees shaded the loveliness
of Merope, the peace of the heart which passes all understanding
and which men have named the Peace of God.</p>
<p>It was the first time since leaving Yandjali that Adams
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
had found himself alone and out of sight of his companions.
He breathed deeply, as if breathing in the air of freedom,
and as he strode along, tramping through the long
grass, his mind, whilst losing no detail of the scene around
him, was travelling far away, even to Paris, and beyond.</p>
<p>Suddenly, twenty yards ahead, bounding and beautiful
in its freedom and grace, a small antelope passed with
the swiftness of an arrow; after it, almost touching it,
came another form, yellow and fierce and flashing through
the grass and vanishing, like the antelope, amidst the
high grasses on the edge of the pool.</p>
<p>The antelope had rushed to the water for protection,
and the leopard had followed, carried forward by its
impetus and ferocity, for Adams could hear its splash
following the splash of the quarry; then a roar split
the silence, echoed from the trees, and sent innumerable
birds fluttering and crying from the edge of the forest
and the edge of the pool.</p>
<p>Adams burst through the long speargrass to see what
was happening, and, standing on the boggy margin, holding
the grasses aside, gazed.</p>
<p>The antelope had vanished as if it had never been, and
a few yards from the shore, in the midst of a lather of
water that seemed beaten up with a great swizzle-stick,
the leopard&#8217;s head, mouth open, roaring, horrified his
eyes for a moment and then was jerked under the surface.</p>
<p>The water closed, eddied, and became still, and Silence
resumed her sway over the Silent Pools.</p>
<p>Something beneath the water had devoured the antelope;
something beneath the water had dragged the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
leopard to its doom, and swish! a huge flail tore the speargrass
to ribbons and sent Adams flying backward with
the wind of its passage.</p>
<p>Another foot and the crocodile&#8217;s tail would have swept
him to the fate of the antelope and leopard.</p>
<p>The place was alive with ferocity and horror, and it
seemed to Adams that the Silent Pools had suddenly
slipped the mask of silence and beauty and shown to him
the face of hideous death.</p>
<p>He wiped the sweat from his brow. He was unarmed,
and it seemed that a man, to walk in safety through this
Garden of Eden, ought to be armed to the teeth. He
turned back to the camp, walking slowly and seeing
nothing of the beauties around him, nothing but the
picture of the leopard&#8217;s face, the paws frantically beating
the water, and a more horrible picture still, the water
resuming its calmness and its peace.</p>
<p>When he reached the camp, he found Berselius and
Meeus absent. After their siesta they had gone for a
stroll by the water&#8217;s edge in the opposite direction to that
which he had taken. The soldiers were on duty, keeping
a watchful eye on the villagers; all were seated, the villagers
in front of their huts and the soldiers in the shade,
with their rifles handy; all, that is to say, except the nigger
child, who was trotting about here and there, and who
seemed quite destitute of fear or concern.</p>
<p>When this creature saw the gigantic Adams who
looked even more gigantic in his white drill clothes, it
laughed and ran away, with hands outspread and head
half slewed round. Then it hid behind a tree. There is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
nothing more charming than the flight of a child when it
wishes to be pursued. It is the instinct of women and
children to run away, so as to lead you on, and it is the
instinct of a rightly constituted man to follow. Adams
came toward the tree, and the villagers seated before
their huts and the soldiers seated in the shade all turned
their heads like automata to watch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi there, you ink-bottle!&#8221; cried Adams. &#8220;Hullo
there, you black dogaroo! Out you come, Uncle Remus!&#8221;
Then he whistled.</p>
<p>He stood still, knowing that to approach closer would
drive the dogaroo to flight or to tree climbing.</p>
<p>There was nothing visible but two small black hands
clutching the tree bole; then the gollywog face, absolutely
split in two with a grin, appeared and vanished.</p>
<p>Adams sat down.</p>
<p>The old, old village woman who was, in fact, the child&#8217;s
grandmother, had been looking on nervously, but when
the big man sat down she knew he was only playing
with the child, and she called out something in the native,
evidently meant to reassure it. But she might have
saved her breath, for the black bundle behind the tree
suddenly left cover and stood with hands folded, looking
at the seated man.</p>
<p>He drew his watch from his pocket and held it up. It
approached. He whistled, and it approached nearer.
Two yards away it stopped dead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tick-tick,&#8221; said Adams, holding up the watch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Papeete N&#8217;quong,&#8221; replied the other, or words to
that effect.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>It spoke in a hoarse, crowing voice not at all unpleasant.
If you listen to English children playing in the street
you will often hear this croaking sort of voice, like the
voice of a young rook.</p>
<p>Papeete struck Adams as a good name for the animal
and, calling him by it, he held out the watch as a bait.</p>
<p>The lured one approached closer, held out a black
claw, and next moment was seized by the foot.</p>
<p>It rolled on the ground like a dog, laughing and kicking,
and Adams tickled it; and the grim soldiers laughed,
showing their sharp white teeth, and the old grandmother
beat her hands together, palm to palm, as
if pleased, and the other villagers looked on without the
ghost of an expression on their black faces.</p>
<p>Then he jumped it on its feet and sent it back to its
people with a slap on its behind, and returned to his tent
to smoke till Berselius and Meeus returned.</p>
<p>But he had worked his own undoing, for, till they
broke camp, Papeete haunted him like a buzz-fly, peeping
at him, sometimes from under the tent, trotting after him
like a dog, watching him from a distance, till he began to
think of &#8220;haunts&#8221; and &#8220;sendings&#8221; and spooks.</p>
<p>When Berselius and his companion returned, the three
men sat and smoked till supper time.</p>
<p>At dark the villagers were driven into their huts and at
the door of each hut lay a sentry.</p>
<p>A big fire was lit, and by its light two more sentries
kept watch over the others and their prisoners. Then the
moon rose, spreading silver over the silence of the pools
and the limitless foliage of the forest.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE PUNISHMENT</h3>
</div>

<p>The sun rose, bringing with it a breeze. Above the
stir and bustle of the birds you could hear the
gentle wind in the tree-tops like the sound of
a sea on a low-tide beach.</p>
<p>The camp was still in gloom, but the whole arc of sky
above the pools was thrilled and filled with living light.
Sapphire blue, dazzling and pale, but deep with infinite
distance, it had an intrinsic brilliancy as though filled
with sunbeams brayed to dust.</p>
<p>The palm tops had caught the morning splendour
and then, rapidly, as though the armies of light were
moving to imperious trumpet-calls, charging with golden
spears, legion on legion, a hurricane of brightness, Day
broke upon the pools.</p>
<p>We call it Day, but what is it, this splendour that comes
from nowhere, and vanishes to nowhere, that strikes our
lives rhythmically like the golden wing of a vast and flying
bird, bearing us along with it in the wind of its flight?</p>
<p>The rotation of the earth? But in the desert, on
the sea, in the spaces of the forest you will see in the dawn
a vision divorced from time, a recurring glance of a beauty
that is eternal, a ray as if from the bright world toward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
which the great bird Time is flying, caught and reflected
to our eyes by every lift of the wing.</p>
<p>The dawn had not brought the truants back from the
forest.</p>
<p>This point Meeus carefully verified. Even the boy
who had been sent to communicate with them had not
returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;No news?&#8221; said Berselius, as he stepped from his tent-door
and glanced around him.</p>
<p>&#8220;None,&#8221; replied Meeus.</p>
<p>Adams now appeared, and the servants who had been
preparing breakfast laid it on the grass. The smell of
coffee filled the air; nothing could be more pleasant than
this out-of-doors breakfast in the bright and lovely morning,
the air fresh with the breeze and the voices of birds.</p>
<p>The villagers were all seated in a group, huddled together
at the extreme left of the row of huts. They were no
longer free, but tied together ankle to ankle by strips of
<i>n&#8217;goji</i>. Only Papeete was at liberty, but he kept at a
distance. He was seated near the old woman, and he
was exploring the interior of an empty tomato tin flung
away by the cook.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will give them two hours more,&#8221; said Meeus, as he
sipped his coffee.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221; said Adams.</p>
<p>Meeus was about to reply when he caught a glance
from Berselius.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I will knock those mud houses of
theirs to pieces. They require a lesson.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor devils!&#8221; said Adams.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>Meeus during the meal did not display a trace of
irritation. From his appearance one might have judged
that the niggers had returned to their work, and that
everything was going well. At times he appeared absent-minded,
and at times he wore a gloomy but triumphant
look, as though some business which had unpleasant
memories attached to it had at last been settled to his
satisfaction.</p>
<p>After breakfast he drew Berselius aside, and the two
men walked away in the direction of the pools, leaving
Adams to smoke his pipe in the shade of the tent.</p>
<p>They came back in about half an hour, and Berselius,
after speaking a few words to Félix, turned to
Adams.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must ask you to return to Fort M&#8217;Bassa and get
everything in readiness for our departure. Félix will
accompany you. I will follow in a couple of hours with
M. Meeus. I am afraid we will have to pull these people&#8217;s
houses down. It&#8217;s a painful duty, but it has to be performed.
You will save yourself the sight of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Adams. Not for a good deal of money
would he have remained to see those wretched hovels
knocked to pieces. He could perceive plainly enough
that the thing had to be done. Conciliation had been
tried, and it was of no avail. He was quite on the side
of Meeus; indeed, he had admired the self-restraint of
this very much tried <i>Chef de Poste</i>. Not a hard word,
not a blow, scarcely a threat had been used. The people
had been spoken to in a fatherly manner, a messenger
had been sent to the truants, and the messenger had joined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
them. At all events he had not returned. Then, certainly,
pull their houses down. But he did not wish to
see the sight. He had nothing to do with the affair, so
filling and lighting another pipe, and leaving all his belongings
to be brought on by Berselius, he turned with Félix
and, saying good-bye to his companions, started.</p>
<p>They had nearly reached the edge of the forest when
shouts from behind caused Adams to turn his head.</p>
<p>The soldiers were shouting to Papeete to come back.</p>
<p>The thing had trotted after Adams like a black dog.
It was within a few yards of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go back,&#8221; shouted Adams.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tick-tick,&#8221; replied Papeete. It was the only English
the creature knew.</p>
<p>It stood frying in the sun, grinning and glistening, till
Adams, with an assumption of ferocity, made for it, then
back it went, and Adams, laughing, plunged under the
veil of leaves.</p>
<p>Berselius, seated at his tent door, looked at his watch.
Meeus, seated beside Berselius, was smoking cigarettes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give him an hour,&#8221; said Berselius. &#8220;He will be far
away enough by that. Besides, the wind is blowing from
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; said Meeus. &#8220;An hour.&#8221; And he continued
to smoke. But his hand was shaking, and he was biting
the cigarette, and his lips were dry so that he had to be
continually licking them.</p>
<p>Berselius was quite calm, but his face was pale, and
he seemed contemplating something at a distance.</p>
<p>When half an hour had passed, Meeus rose suddenly to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
his feet and began to walk about, up and down, in front of
the tent, up and down, up and down, as a man walks
when he is in distress of mind.</p>
<p>The black soldiers also seemed uneasy, and the villagers
huddled closer together like sheep. Papeete alone
seemed undisturbed. He was playing now with the old
tomato tin, out of which he had scraped and licked every
vestige of the contents.</p>
<p>Suddenly Meeus began crying out to the soldiers in a
hard, sharp voice like the yelping of a dog.</p>
<p>The time was up, and the soldiers knew. They ranged
up, chattering and laughing, and all at once, as if produced
from nowhere, two rhinoceros hide whips appeared
in the hands of two of the tallest of the blacks.
Rhinoceros hide is more than an inch thick; it is clear and
almost translucent when properly prepared. In the form
of a whip it is less an instrument of punishment than a
weapon. These whips were not the smoothly prepared
whips used for light punishment; they had angles that
cut like sword edges. One wonders what those sentimental
people would say&mdash;those sentimental people who
cry out if a burly ruffian is ordered twenty strokes with the
cat&mdash;could they see a hundred <i>chicotte</i> administered
with a whip that is flexible as india-rubber, hard as steel.</p>
<p>Two soldiers at the yelping orders of Meeus cut the old
woman apart from her fellows and flung her on the ground.</p>
<p>The two soldiers armed with whips came to her, and
she did not speak a word, nor cry out, but lay grinning at
the sun.</p>
<p>Papeete, seeing his old grandmother treated like this,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
dropped his tomato tin and screamed, till a soldier put a
foot on his chest and held him down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two hundred <i>chicotte</i>,&#8221; cried Meeus, and like the echo
of his words came the first dull, coughing blow.</p>
<p>The villagers shrieked and cried altogether at each
blow, but the victim, after the shriek which followed the
first blow, was dumb.</p>
<p>Free as a top which is being whipped by a boy, she
gyrated, making frantic efforts to escape, and like boys
whipping a top, the two soldiers with their whips pursued
her, blow following blow.</p>
<p>A semicircle of blood on the ground marked her gyrations.
Once she almost gained her feet, but a blow in the
face sent her down again. She put her hands to her poor
face, and the rhinoceros whips caught her on the hands,
breaking them. She flung herself on her back and they
beat her on the stomach, cutting through the walls of the
abdomen till the intestines protruded. She flung herself
on her face and they cut into her back with the whips
till her ribs were bare and the fat bulged through the
long slashes in the skin.</p>
<p>Verily it was a beating to the bitter end, and Meeus,
pale, dripping with sweat, his eyes dilated to a rim, ran
about laughing, shouting&mdash;</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Two hundred chicotte. Two hundred chicotte.&#8221;</i></p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>He cried the words like a parrot, not knowing what he
said.</p>
<p>And Berselius?</p>
<p>Berselius, also dripping with sweat, his eyes also dilated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
to a rim, tottering like a drunken man, gazed, drinking,
drinking the sight in.</p>
<p>Down, away down in the heart of man there is a trapdoor.
Beyond the instincts of murder and assassination,
beyond the instincts that make a Count Cajus or a Marquis
de Sade, it lies, and it leads directly into the last and
nethermost depths of hell, where sits in eternal damnation
Eccelin de Romano.</p>
<p>Cruelty for cruelty&#8217;s sake: the mad pleasure of watching
suffering in its most odious form: that is the passion
which hides demon-like beneath this door, and that was
the passion that held Berselius now in its grip.</p>
<p>He had drunk of all things, this man, but never of such
a potent draught as this demon held now to his lips&mdash;and
not for the first time. The draught would have been
nothing but for the bitterness of it, the horror of it, the
mad delight of knowing the fiendishness of it, and drinking,
drinking, drinking, till reason, self-respect, and soul, were
overthrown.</p>
<p>The thing that had been a black woman and, now,
seemed like nothing earthly except a bundle of red rags,
gave up the miserable soul it contained and, stiffening
in the clutches of tetanus, became a hoop.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>What happened then to the remaining villagers could
be heard echoing for miles through the forest in the shrieks
and wails of the tortured ones.</p>
<p>One cannot write of unnamable things, unprintable
deeds. The screams lasted till noon.</p>
<p>At one o&#8217;clock the punitive expedition had departed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
leaving the Silent Pools to their silence. The houses of
the village had been destroyed and trampled out. The
sward lay covered with shapeless remains, and scarcely
had the last of the expedition departed, staggering and
half drunk with the delirium of their deeds, than from the
blue above, like a stone, dropped a vulture.</p>
<p>A vulture drops like a stone, with wings closed till it
reaches within a few yards of the ground; then it spreads
its wings and, with wide-opened talons, lights on its prey.</p>
<p>Then, a marabout with fore-slanting legs and domed-out
wings, came sailing silently down to the feast, and
another vulture, and yet another.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>DUE SOUTH</h3>
</div>

<p>When Berselius and Meeus returned to Fort
M&#8217;Bassa Adams, who met them, came to the
conclusion that Berselius had been drinking.
The man&#8217;s face looked stiff and bloated, just as a man&#8217;s
face looks after a terrible debauch. Meeus looked cold
and hard and old, but his eyes were bright and he was
seemingly quite himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow I shall start,&#8221; said Berselius. &#8220;Not
to-day. I am tired and wish to sleep.&#8221; He went off
to the room where his bed was, and cast himself on it and
fell instantly into a deep and dreamless sleep.</p>
<p>The innocent may wonder how such a man would
dare to sleep&mdash;dare to enter that dark country so close
to the frontier of death. But what should the innocent
know of a Berselius, who was yet a living man and walked
the earth but a few years ago, and whose prototype is
alive to-day. Alive and powerful and lustful, great in
mind, body, and estate.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Before sunrise next morning the expedition was marshalled
in the courtyard for the start.</p>
<p>A great fire burned in the space just before the house,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
and by its light the stores and tents were taken from the
go-down. The red light of the fire lit up the black
glistening skins of the porters as they loaded themselves
with the chop boxes and tents and guns; lit up the red
fez caps of the onlooking &#8220;soldiers,&#8221; their glittering
white teeth, their white eyeballs, and the barrels of their
rifles.</p>
<p>Beyond and below the fort the forest stretched in the
living starlight like an infinite white sea. The tree-tops
were roofed with a faint mist, no breath of wind disturbed
it, and in contrast to the deathly stillness of all that dead-white
world the sky, filled with leaping stars, seemed alive
and vocal.</p>
<p>It was chill up here just before dawn. Hence the fire.
Food had been served out to the porters, and they ate it
whilst getting things ready and loading up. Berselius
and his companions were breakfasting in the guest house
and the light of the paraffin lamp lay on the veranda
yellow as topaz in contrast with the red light of the fire
in the yard.</p>
<p>Everything was ready for the start. They were waiting
now for the sun.</p>
<p>Then, away to the east, as though a vague azure wind
had blown up under the canopy of darkness, the sky,
right down to the roof of the forest, became translucent
and filled with distance.</p>
<p>A reef of cloud like a vermilion pencil-line materialized
itself, became a rose-red feather tipped with dazzling
gold, and dissolved as if washed away by the rising sea
of light.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p>A great bustle spread through the courtyard. The
remaining stores were loaded up, and under the direction
of Félix, the porters formed in a long line, their loads on
their heads.</p>
<p>As the expedition left the compound it was already
day. The edge of the sun had leaped over the edge of
the forest, the world was filled with light, and the sky was
a sparkling blue.</p>
<p>What a scene that was! The limitless sea of snow-white
mist rippled over by the sea of light, the mist
billowed and spiralled by the dawn wind, great palm tops
bursting through the haze, glittering effulgent with dew,
birds breaking to the sky in coloured flocks, snow, and
light, and the green of tremendous vegetation, and over
all, new-built and beautiful, the blue, tranquil dome of sky.</p>
<p>It was song materialized in colour and form, the song
of the primeval forests breaking from the mists of chaos,
tremendous, triumphant, joyous, finding day at last, and
greeting him with the glory of the palms, with the
rustle of the n&#8217;sambyas tossing their golden bugles
to the light, the drip and sigh of the euphorbia trees, the
broad-leaved plantains and the thousand others whose
forms hold the gloom of the forest in the mesh of their
leaves.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have awakened, O God! I have awakened. Behold
me, O Lord! I am Thine!&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus to the splendour of the sun and led by the trumpet
of the wind sang the forest. A hundred million trees lent
their voices to the song. A hundred million trees&mdash;acacia
and palm, m&#8217;bina and cottonwood, thorn and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
mimosa; in gloom, in shine, in valley and on rise, mist-strewn
and sun-stricken, all bending under the deep sweet
billows of the wind.</p>
<p>At the edge of the forest Berselius and Adams took
leave of Meeus. Neither Berselius nor Meeus showed
any sign of the past day. They had &#8220;slept it off.&#8221; As
for Adams, he knew nothing, except that the villagers had
been punished and their houses destroyed.</p>
<p>The way lay due south. They were now treading
that isthmus of woods which connects the two great forests
which, united thus, make the forest of M&#8217;Bonga. The
trees in this vast connecting wood are different from the
trees in the main forests. You find here enormous acacias,
monkey-bread trees, raphia palms and baobabs; less
gloom, and fewer creeping and hanging plants.</p>
<p>Berselius, as a rule, brought with him a taxidermist,
but this expedition was purely for sport. The tusks
of whatever elephants were slain would be brought back,
but no skins; unless, indeed, they were fortunate enough
to find some rare or unknown species.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>SUN-WASHED SPACES</h3>
</div>

<p>A two days&#8217; march brought them clear of the
woods and into a broken country, vast, sunstrewn
and silent; a beautiful desolation where the
tall grass waved in the wind, and ridge and hollow, plain
and mimosa tree, led the eye beyond, and beyond, to
everlasting space.</p>
<p>Standing here alone, and listening, the only sound
from all that great sunlit country was the sound of the
wind in the grasses near by.</p>
<p>Truly this place was at the very back of the world, the
hinterland of the primeval forests. Strike eastward far
enough and you would sight the snow-capped crest of
Kilimanjaro, King of African mountains, sitting snow-crowned
above the vast territory to which he has given
his name, and which stretches from Lake Eyasi to the
Pare Mountains. The hunters of Kilimanjaro, which
once was the home of elephants, have thinned the herds
and driven them to wander. Elephants that a hundred
years ago, even fifty years ago, were almost fearless of
man, have altered their habits from the bitter lessons they
have received, and now are only to be found in the most
inaccessible places. Should they cling to more inhabited
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
districts, they come out of the sheltered places only by
night. A man may spend years in an elephant district
without once seeing an elephant. Driven by the necessity
of food and the fear of man, the great herds wander in
their wonderful and mysterious journeys for hundreds and
hundreds of miles. Never lying down, sleeping as they
stand, always on guard, dim of sight yet keen of smell,
they pass where there are trees, feeding as they go, stripping
branches of leaves. Alarmed, or seeking a new feeding
place, a herd moves in the rainy season, when
the ground is soft, with the silence and swiftness of
a cloud shadow; in the dry season when the ground is
hard, the sound of them stampeding is like the drums of
an army.</p>
<p>&#8220;Elephants,&#8221; said Berselius, pointing to some bundles
of dried stuff lying near a vangueria bush. &#8220;That stuff is
a bundle of bowstring hemp. They chew it and drop it.
Oh, that has been dropped a long time ago; see, there you
have elephants again.&#8221;</p>
<p>A tree standing alone showed half its bark ripped off,
tusked off by some old bull elephant, and above the tusk
marks, some fifteen feet up, could be seen the rubbing
mark where great shoulders had scratched themselves.</p>
<p>As they marched, making due south, Berselius in that
cold manner which never left him, and which made comradeship
with the man impossible and reduced companionship
to the thinnest bond, talked to Adams about the
game they were after, telling in a few graphic sentences
and not without feeling the wonderful story of the moving
herds, to whom distance is nothing, to whom mountains
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
are nothing, to whom the thickest jungle is nothing. The
poem of the children of the mammoth who have walked
the earth with the mastodon, who have stripped the trees
wherein dwelt arboreal man, who have wandered under
the stars and suns of a million years, seen rivers change
their courses and hills arise where plains had been, and
yet remain, far strewn and thinned out, it is true, but
living still. At noon they halted and the tents were pitched
for a four hours&#8217; rest.</p>
<p>Adams, whilst dinner was preparing, walked away
by himself till the camp was hidden by a ridge, then he
stood and looked around him.</p>
<p>Alone, like this, the spirit of the scene appeared before
him: the sun, and wind, and sky; the vast, vast spaces
of waving grass, broken by the beds of dried-up streams,
strewn here and there with mimosas and thorns, here dim
with the growth of vangueria bushes, here sharp and
gray-green with cactus; this giant land, infinite, sunlit,
and silent, spoke to him in a new language.</p>
<p>It seemed to Adams that he had never known freedom
before.</p>
<p>A shadow swept by him on the grass. He looked
up and watched the great bird that had cast the shadow
sailing away on the wind, dwindling to a point, and vanishing
in the dazzling blue.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>FAR INTO ELEPHANT LAND</h3>
</div>

<p>They sighted a small herd of giraffe two days
later, but so far off as to be beyond pursuit;
but before evening, just as they were about to
camp by some pools, they came across rhino.</p>
<p>Berselius&#8217;s quick eye spotted the beasts, a bull and a
cow. They were in the open, under shelter of some thick
grass; the bull was half sitting up, and his head and horn
in the evening light might have been taken for the stump of
a broken tree. The cow was not visible at first, but almost
immediately after they sighted the bull, she heaved herself
up and stood a silhouette against the sky.</p>
<p>The wind was blowing from the beasts, so it was quite
possible to get close up to them. The meat would be
useful, so Berselius and his companion started, with
Félix carrying the guns.</p>
<p>As they drew close Adams noticed that the back of
the great cow seemed alive and in motion. Half a dozen
rhinoceros birds, in fact, were upon it, and almost immediately,
sighting the hunters, they rose chattering and
fluttering in the air.</p>
<p>These birds are the guardians of the half-blind rhinoceros.
They live on the parasites that infest his skin.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
It is a partnership. The birds warn the rhinoceros of
danger, and he, vicariously, feeds the birds. Scarcely
had the birds given warning than the bull heaved himself
up. Berselius&#8217;s rifle rang out, but the light was uncertain,
and the brute wounded, but not mortally, charged forward
took a half circle, swung his head from side to side in
search of his assailant, and sighted the cow. Instantly,
horn down and squealing, he charged her. She met
him horn to horn, and the smash could be heard at the
camp where the porters and the soldiers stood gazing
open-mouthed at the battle between the two great brutes
charging each other in the low evening light, fighting with
the ferocity of tigers and the agility of cats.</p>
<p>Adams, close up as he was, had a better view, and
unless he had seen with his own eyes, he could not have
believed that two animals so heavy and unwieldy
could display such nimbleness and such quickness of
ferocity.</p>
<p>It was the wickedest sight, and it was brought to an
end at last by the rifle of Berselius.</p>
<p>Curiously enough, neither brute had injured the other
very much. The horns which, had they been of ivory,
must have been shivered, were intact, for the horn of a
rhinoceros is flexible; it is built up of a conglomeration
of hairs, and though, perhaps, the most unbreakable thing
in the universe, it bends up to a certain point just as a
rapier does.</p>
<p>Next morning, two hours after daybreak, Félix, who
was scouting just ahead of the column, came running
back with news he had struck elephant spoor. Every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
tooth in his head told the tale. Not only spoor, but the
spoor of a vast herd cutting right across the line of march.</p>
<p>Berselius came forward to examine, and Adams came
with him.</p>
<p>The dry ground and wire grass was not the best medium
for taking the track of the beasts, but to the experienced
eyes of Berselius and the Zappo Zap everything was clear.
A herd of elephant had passed not long ago, and they
were undisturbed and unsuspicious. When elephants
are suspicious they march in lines, single file, one stepping
in the tracks of another. This herd was spread wide and
going easy of mind, but at what pace it would be impossible
to say.</p>
<p>The long boat-shaped back feet of the bulls leave a
print unmistakable in the rainy season when the ground
is soft, but still discernible to the trained eye in the dry
season. Félix declared that there were at least twenty
bulls in the herd, and some of huge size.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long is it since they passed here?&#8221; asked
Berselius.</p>
<p>Félix held up the fingers of one hand. From certain
indications he came to the conclusion they had passed late
in the night, three hours or so before daybreak. They
numbered forty or fifty, leaving aside the calves that might
be with them. He delivered these opinions, speaking in
the native, and Berselius instantly gave the order, &#8220;Left
wheel!&#8221; to the crowd of porters; and at the word the
long column turned at right angles to the line of march
and struck due west, treading the track of the herd.</p>
<p>Nothing is more exciting than this following in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
track of a mammoth army whose tactics you cannot foresee.
This herd might be simply moving a few miles in
search of a new feeding ground, or it might be making one
of those great sweeping marches covering hundreds of
miles that the mysterious elephant people make at the
dictates of their mysterious instinct. It might be moving
at a gentle pace, or swifter than a man could run. A
mile on the new route they came on a broken tree,
a great tree broken down as if by a storm; the fractures
were quite recent. The elephant folk had done this.
They came across another tree whose sides, facing north
and south, had been clearly barked, and the pieces of the
bark, farther on, that had been chewed and flung away.</p>
<p>With one stroke of a tusk passing a tree, and without
stopping, an elephant will tear off a strip of bark; and
it was curious to see how the bark of this tree to east and
west was intact. The moving herd had not stopped.
Just in passing, an elephant on either side of the tree had
taken his slice of bark, chewed it and flung it away.
There were also small trees trodden down mercilessly
under foot. Thus the great track of the herd lay
before the hunters, but not a sign in all the sunlit, silent
country before them of the herd itself.</p>
<p>It was Berselius&#8217;s aim to crowd up his men as quickly
as a forced march could do it, camp and then pursue the
herd with a few swift followers, the barest possible amount
of stores and one tent.</p>
<p>The calabashes and the water bottles had been filled
at the last halt, but it was desirable to find water for the
evening&#8217;s camping place.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></p>
<p>It was now that Berselius showed his capacity as a
driver and his own enormous store of energy.</p>
<p>He took the tail of the column, and woe to the porters
who lagged behind! Félix was with him, and Adams, who
was heading the column, could hear the shouts of the
Zappo Zap. The men with their loads went at a quick
walk, sometimes breaking into a trot, urged forward by
the gun-butt of Félix.</p>
<p>The heat was sweltering, but there was no rest. On, on,
on, ever on through a country that changed not at all;
the same breaks and ridges, the same limitless plains of
waving grass, the same scant trees, the same heat-shaken
horizon toward which the elephant road led straight,
unwavering, endless.</p>
<p>The brain reeled with the heat and the dazzle, but
the column halted not nor stayed. The energy of Berselius
drove it forward as the energy of steam drives an engine.
His voice, his very presence, put life into flagging legs
and sight into dazzled eyes. He spared neither himself
nor others; the game was ahead, the spoor was hot, and
the panther in his soul drove him forward.</p>
<p>Toward noon they halted for two hours where some
bushes spread their shade. The porters lay down on their
bellies, with arms outspread, having taken a draught of
water and a bite of food; they lay in absolute and profound
slumber. Adams, nearly as exhausted, lay on his
back. Even Félix showed signs of the journey, but
Berselius sat right back into the bushes, with his knees
drawn up and, with eyes fixed on the eastern distance,
brooded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></p>
<p>He was always like this on a great hunt, when the game
was near. Silent and brooding, and morose to the point
of savagery.</p>
<p>One might almost have fancied that in far distant days
this man had been a tiger, and that the tiger still lived
slumbering in his soul, triumphant over death, driving
him forth at intervals from civilization to wander in the
wild places of the earth and slay.</p>
<p>Two hours past noon they resumed their journey: on,
on, on, treading the elephant track which still went due
east straight as an arrow to the blue horizon. The frightful
tiredness they had felt before the noonday halt had
passed, giving place to a dull, dreamy feeling, such as
comes after taking opium. The column marched mechanically
and without thought, knowing only two things, the
feel of the hard ground and grass beneath their feet, and
the smiting of the sun on their backs.</p>
<p>Thus the galley slaves of old laboured at their oars and
the builders of the pyramids beneath their loads, all
moving like one man. But here was no tune of flutes
to set the pace, or monotonous song to help the lifting;
only the voice of Berselius like a whip-lash, and the gun-butt
of Félix drumming on the ribs of laggards.</p>
<p>A light, hot wind was blowing in their faces. Adams,
still at the head of the column, had suffered severely during
the morning march, and the re-start after the noon
rest was painful to him as a beating; but the reserve forces
of a powerful constitution that had never been tampered
with were now coming into play, and, after a time, he felt
little discomfort. His body, like a wound-up mechanism,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
did all the work; his mind became divorced from it; he
experienced a curious exaltation, like that which comes
from drink, only finer far and more ethereal. The column
seemed marching far swifter than it was marching in
reality, the vast sunlit land seemed vaster even than it
was; the wind-blown grass, the far distant trees, the
circling skyline, all spoke of freedom unknown to man:
the freedom of the herd they were pursuing; the freedom
of the bird flying overhead; the freedom of the wind blowing
in the grass; the freedom of the limitless, endless,
sunlit country. Meridians of silence, and light, and
plains, and trees, and mountains, and forests. Parallels
of virgin land.</p>
<p>He was feeling what the bird knows and feels when it
beats up the mountains or glides down the vales of air;
what the elephant herd knows and feels when it moves
over mountains and across plains; what the antelopes
know when distance calls them.</p>
<p>A shout from Félix, and the Zappo Zap came running
up the line; his head was flung up and he was sniffing the
air. Then, walking beside Adams, he stared ahead right
away over the country before them to the far skyline.</p>
<p>&#8220;Elephant smell,&#8221; he replied, when Adams asked him
what was the matter; then, turning, he shouted some
words in the native back to Berselius, and tramped on
beside Adams, his nose raised to the wind, of which each
puff brought the scent stronger.</p>
<p>Adams could smell nothing, but the savage could tell
that right ahead there were elephants; close up, too, yet
not a sign of them could be seen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></p>
<p>This puzzled him, and what puzzles a savage frightens
him.</p>
<p>His nose told him that here were elephants in sight of
his eyes; his eyes told him that there were none.</p>
<p>All at once the column came to a dead halt. Porters
flung down their loads and cried out in fright. Even
Berselius stood stock-still in astonishment.</p>
<p>From the air, blown on the wind from no visible source,
came the shrill trumpeting of an elephant.</p>
<p>There, in broad daylight, close up to them, the sound
came with the shock of the supernatural. Nothing stirred
in all the land but the grass bending to the wind. There
was not even a bird in the air; yet close to them an elephant
was trumpeting shrilly and fiercely as elephants trumpet
when they charge.</p>
<p>Again came the sound, and once again, but this time it
broke lamentably to a complaint that died away to silence.</p>
<p>Instantly the Zappo Zap came to himself. He knew
that sound. An elephant was dying somewhere near by,
caught in a trap possibly. He rushed down the line, gun-butting
the porters back to their places, shouting to
Berselius, helping loads up on the heads of the men
who had dropped them, so that in a minute the column
was in motion again and going swiftly to make up for
lost time.</p>
<p>Five minutes brought them to a slight rise in the ground,
beyond which, deep-cut, rock-strewn and skeleton-dry,
lay the bed of a river.</p>
<p>In the rains this would be scarcely fordable, but now
not even a trickle of water could be seen. On the floor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
of this river-bed, like a huge dark rock, lay the body of
an elephant.</p>
<p>An African elephant is the biggest creature on earth,
far bigger than his Indian cousin, and far more formidable
looking. Adams could scarcely believe that the thing
before him was the body of an animal, as he contrasted
its size with Félix, who had raced down the slope and was
examining the carcass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead!&#8221; cried Félix, and the porters, taking heart,
descended, but not without groaning and lamentations,
for it is well-known to the natives that whoever comes
across an elephant lying down must die, speedily and by
violent means; and this elephant was lying down in very
truth, his tusks humbly lowered to the ground, his great
ears motionless, just as death had left him.</p>
<p>It was a bull and surely, from his size, the father of the
herd. Berselius considered the beast to be of great age.
One tusk was decayed badly and the other was chipped
and broken, and on the skin of the side were several of
those circular sores one almost always finds on the body
of a rhinoceros, &#8220;dundos,&#8221; as the natives call them; old
scars and wounds told their tale of old battles and the
wanderings of many years.</p>
<p>It might have been eighty or a hundred years since
the creature had first seen the light and started on its
wonderful journey over mountains and plains through
jungle and forest, lying down maybe only twenty times in
all those years, wandering hither and thither, and knowing
not that every step of its journey was a step closer
to here.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>Just this little piece of ground on which it lay had been
plotted out for it a hundred years ago, and it had come to
it by a million mazy paths, but not less surely than had it
followed the leading of a faultlessly directed arrow.</p>
<p>The herd had left it here to die. Berselius, examining
the body closely, could find no wound. He concluded
that it had come to its end just as old men come to their
end at last&mdash;the mechanism had failed, hindered, perhaps,
by some internal disease, and it had lain down to
wait for death.</p>
<p>The tusks were not worth taking, and the party pursued
its way up the eastern bank of the river, where the
herd had also evidently pursued its way, and then on, on,
across the country due east, in the track they had followed
since morning.</p>
<p>As they left the river-bed a tiny dot in the sky above,
which they had not noticed, enlarged, and like a stone
from the blue fell a vulture. It lit on the carcass; then
came a kite slanting down to the feast, and then from the
blue, like stones dropped from the careless hand of a
giant, vulture after vulture.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>THE GREAT HERD</h3>
</div>

<p>Félix kept his place beside Adams at the head
of the column. The black seemed morose, and
at the same time, excited.</p>
<p>Two things had disturbed him: the bad luck of meeting
a lying-down elephant and the fact that a giraffe
was with the herd. He had spotted giraffe spoor in the
river-bed where the ground was sandy and showed up
the impression well.</p>
<p>Now, the giraffe has the keen eyesight of a bird, and
when he throws in his lot with the elephant folk who,
though half-blind, have the keen scent of hounds, the
combination is bad for the hunter.</p>
<p>An hour before sundown they struck some pools beside
which grew a tree, the biggest they had yet come
across, and here Berselius gave the order, halt and camp.</p>
<p>To half of the porters it was an order to fall down
flat, their loads beside them, their arms outspread absolutely
broken with the weariness of the march, broken,
and speechless, and motionless, and plunged into such a
depth of slumber that had you kicked them they would
not have moved.</p>
<p>Berselius, himself, was nearly exhausted. He sat with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
his back against the tree and gave his orders in a languid
voice, and it was very curious to see the tents going up,
wielded by men who seemed working in their sleep,
slowly and with fumbling fingers, tripping over each other,
pausing, hesitating, yet working all the same, and all in
the still level light of evening that lent unreality to the
scene.</p>
<p>Luck was against Berselius. It was quite within the
bounds of probability that the herd might have halted
here by the water for the night; but they had not. They
had drunk here, for the pool was all trodden up and still
muddy, and then gone on.</p>
<p>They were evidently making one of their great marches,
and it was probable now that they would never be caught
up with. Under these circumstances, Berselius determined
to halt for the night.</p>
<p>Some small trees and bushes were cut to make a camp
fire, and when they had finished supper Berselius, still
with his back to the tree, sat talking to Adams by the
light of the crackling branches.</p>
<p>He did not seem in the least put out with his failure.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rains will be on us in a week or two,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Then you will see elephants all over this place. They
lie up in the inaccessible places in the dry season, but
when the wet weather comes the herds spread over the
plains. Not such herds as the one we have been following&mdash;it
is rarely one comes across one like that.
However, to-morrow we may have better luck with them.
Félix tells me that forty miles beyond there, where they
have gone, there are a lot of trees. They may stop and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
feed, and if they do, we will have them. To-morrow
I shall start light. Leave the main camp here. You
and I and Félix, and four of the best of those men, and
the smallest tent, enough stores for three or four days.
Yes, to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; The man dozed off, sleep-stricken,
the pipe between his teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow!&#8221; Portentous word!</p>
<p>They retired to their tents. Two sentries were posted
to keep the fire going and to keep watch. The porters
lay about, looking just like men who had fallen in battle,
and after awhile the sentries, having piled the fire with
wood, sat down, and the moon rose, flooding the whole
wide land with light.</p>
<p>She had scarcely lifted her own diameter above the
horizon when the sentries, flat on their backs, with arms
extended, were sleeping as soundly as the others. Brilliant
almost as daylight, still and peaceful as death,
the light of the great moon flooded the land, paling the
stars and casting the shadows of the tents across the
sleepers, and the wind, which was now blowing from the
west, shook the twigs of the tree, like skeleton fingers,
over the flicker of the red burning camp-fire.</p>
<p>Now, the great herd of elephants had been making,
as Berselius imagined possible, for the forest that lay
forty miles to the east.</p>
<p>They had reached it before sundown, and had begun
to feed, stripping branches of their leaves, the enormous
trunks reaching up like snakes and whirling the
leaves Catherine-wheellike down enormous throats; the
purring and grumbling of their cavernous bellies, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
rubbing of rough shoulders against the bark, the stamping
of feet crushing the undergrowth, resounded in echoes
amongst the trees. The big bull giraffe that had cast
its lot in with the herd was busy, too, tearing and snapping
down twigs and leaves, feeding like the others, who
were all feeding like one, even to the eighteen-month-old
calves busy at the teats of their enormous dams.</p>
<p>The sunlight, level and low, struck the wonderful
picture. Half the herd were in the wood, and you could
see the tree branches bending and shaking to the reaching
trunks. Half the herd were grazing on the wood&#8217;s
edge, the giraffe amidst them, its clouded body burning
in the sunset against the green of the trees.</p>
<p>The wind was blowing steadily along the edge of the
wood and against a band of hunters of the Congo State,
blacks armed with rifles, who were worming their way
along from tree bole to tree bole, till within shooting distance
of the bull elephant nearest to them.</p>
<p>The creatures feeding knew nothing of their danger
till three shots, that sounded like one, rang out, and the
bull, struck in the neck, the shoulder, and between the
ear and eye, fell, literally all of a heap, as though some
giant&#8217;s scimitar had swept its legs away from under it.</p>
<p>At this moment the sun&#8217;s lower edge had just touched
the horizon. The whole visible herd on the edge of the
wood, at the sound of the shots and the crash of the falling
bull, wheeled, trumpeted wildly, and with trunks
swung up, ears spread wide, swept away toward the
sunset, following the track by which they had come;
whilst, bursting from the woods, leaf-strewn, with green
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
branches tangled in their tusks, furious and mad with
fright, came the remainder, following in the same track,
sweeping after the others, and filling the air with the
thunder of their stampede.</p>
<p>Shot after shot rang out, but not an elephant was
touched, and in two great clouds, which coalesced, the
broken herd with the sound of a storm passed away
along the road they had come by, the night closing on
them as the sun vanished from the sky.</p>
<p>Berselius had not reckoned on this. No man can
reckon on what the wilderness will do. The oldest
hunter is the man who knows most surely the dramatic
surprises of the hunt, but the oldest hunter would never
have taken this into his calculations.</p>
<p>Here, back along the road they had travelled all day,
was coming, not a peacefully moving herd, but a storm
of elephants. Elephants who had been disturbed in
feeding, shot at, and shot after, filled with the dull fury
that dwells in an elephant&#8217;s brain for days, and with the
instinct for safety that would carry them perhaps a hundred
miles before dawn.</p>
<p>And right in the track of this terrible army of destruction
lay the sleeping camp, the camp fire smouldering
and fluttering its flames on the wind.</p>
<p>And the wind had shifted!</p>
<p>With the dark, as though the scene had been skilfully
prepared by some infernal dramatist, just as the cover of
night shut down tight and sealed, and suddenly, like a
box-lid that had been upheld by the last rays of the setting
sun, just as the great stars burst out above as if at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
the touch of an electric button, the wind shifted right
round and blew due east.</p>
<p>This change of wind would dull the sound of the oncoming
host to the people at the camp; at the same time it
would bring the scent of the human beings to the elephants.</p>
<p>The effect of this might be to make them swerve away
from the line they were taking, but it would be impossible
to tell for certain. The only sure thing was, that
if they continued in their course till within eyeshot of the
camp fire, they would charge it and destroy everything
round about it in their fury.</p>
<p>A camp fire to an angry elephant is the equivalent
of a red rag to a bull.</p>
<p>Thus the dramatic element of uncertainty was introduced
into the tragedy unfolding on the plains, and the
great stars seemed to leap like expectant hearts of fire
till the moon broke over the horizon, casting the flying
shadows of the great beasts before them.</p>
<p>The first furious stampede had settled into a rapid
trot, to a sound like the sound of a hundred muffled drums
beating a rataplan.</p>
<p>Instinct told the herd that immediate danger was
past, also that for safety they would have to cover an
immense space of country; so they settled to the pace
most suitable for the journey. And what a pace it was,
and what a sight!</p>
<p>Drifting across the country before the great white
moon, fantastic beasts and more fantastic shadows,
in three divisions line ahead, with the lanes of moonlight
ruled between each line; calves by the cows,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
bulls in the van, they went, keeping to the scent of the
track they had come by as unswervingly as a train keeps
to the metals.</p>
<p>The giraffe was still with them. He and his shadow,
gliding with compass-like strides a hundred yards away
from the southward column; and just as the scent of the
camp came to his mammoth friends, the sight of the camp
fire, like a red spark, struck his keen eyes.</p>
<p>With a rasping note of warning he swerved to the south.</p>
<p>Now was the critical moment. Everything lay with the
decision of the bulls leading the van, who, with trunks
flung up and crooked forward, were holding the scent
as a man holds a line. They had only a moment of time,
but he who knows the elephant folk knows well the rapidity
with which their minds can reason, and from their action
it would seem that the arbiters of Berselius&#8217;s fate reasoned
thus: &#8220;The enemy were behind; they are now in front.
So be it. Let us charge.&#8221;</p>
<p>And they charged, with a blast of trumpeting that
shook the sky; with trunks flung up and forward-driving
tusks, ears spread like great sails, and a sound like the
thunder of artillery, they charged the scent, the body of
the herd following the leaders, as the body of a battering-ram
follows the head.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Adams, when he had flung himself down in his tent,
fell asleep instantly. This sleep, which was profound
and dreamless, lasted but half an hour, and was succeeded
by a slumber in which, as in a darkened room where a
magic-lantern is being operated, vivid and fantastic pictures
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
arose before him. He was on the march with the
column through a country infinite as is space; the road
they were taking, like the road to the tombs of the Chinese
kings, was lined on either side with animals done in stone.
At first these were tigers, and then, as though some
veil of illusion had been withdrawn, he discovered them
to be creatures far larger and more cruel, remorseless,
and fearful than tigers; they were elephants&mdash;great
stone elephants that had been standing there under the
sun from everlasting, and they dwindled in perspective
from giants to pigmies and from pigmies to grains of
sand, for they were the guardians of a road whose end
was infinity.</p>
<p>Then these vanished, but the elephant country under
the burning sun remained. There was nothing to be
seen but the sun-washed spaces of wind-blown grass,
and broken ground, and scattered trees, till across the
sky in long procession, one following the other, passed
shadow elephants. Shadows each thrice the height of the
highest mountain, and these things called forth in the
mind of the sleeper such a horror and depth of dread that
he started awake with the sweat running down his face.</p>
<p>Sleep was shattered, and in the excitement and nerve-tension
of over-tiredness he lay tossing on his back. The
long march of the day before, in which men had matched
themselves against moving mountains, the obsession of
the things they had been pursuing, had combined to
shatter sleep.</p>
<p>He came out in the open for a breath of air.</p>
<p>The camp was plunged in slumber. The two sentries
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
ordered by Berselius to keep watch and to feed the fire
lay like the others, with arms outspread; the fire was burning
low, as though drowned out by the flood of moonlight,
and Adams was on the point of going to the pile of
fuel for some sticks to feed it, when he saw a sight which
was one of the strangest, perhaps, that he would ever see.</p>
<p>The sentry lying on the right of the fire sat up, rose to
his feet, went to the wood pile, took an armful of fuel
and flung it on the embers.</p>
<p>The fire roared up and crackled, and the sleep-walker,
who had performed this act with wide-staring eyes that
saw nothing, returned to his place and lay down.</p>
<p>It was as if the order of Berselius still rang in his ears
and the vision of Berselius still dominated his mind.</p>
<p>Adams, thinking of this strange thing, stood with
the wind fanning his face, looking over the country to
the west, the country they had traversed that day in tribulation
under the burning sun. There was nothing to
tell now of the weary march, the pursuit of phantoms,
the long, long miles of labour; all was peaceful and coldly
beautiful, moonlit and silent.</p>
<p>He was about to return to his tent when a faint sound
struck his ear. A faint, booming sound, just like that
which troubles us when the eardrum vibrates on its own
account from exhaustion or the effect of drugs.</p>
<p>He stopped his ears and the sound ceased.</p>
<p>Then he knew that the sound was a real sound borne
on the air.</p>
<p>He thought it was coming to him on the wind, which
was now blowing steadily in his face, and he strained
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
his eyes to see the cause; but he saw nothing. There
was no cloud in the sky or storm on the horizon, yet the
sound was increasing. Boom, boom, becoming deeper
and more sonorous, now like the long roll of muffled drums,
now like the sea bursting in the sea-caves of a distant
coast, or the drums of the cyclone when they beat the
charge for the rushing winds. But the heart-searching
feature of this strange booming in the night was a rhythm,
a pulsation that spoke of life. This was no dull shifting
of matter, as in an earthquake, or of air as in a storm;
this sound was alive.</p>
<p>Adams sprang to the tent where Berselius was sleeping,
and dragged him out by the arm, crying, &#8220;Listen!&#8221;</p>
<p>He would have cried, &#8220;See!&#8221; but the words withered
on his lips at the sight which was now before him as he
faced east.</p>
<p>An acre of rollicking and tossing blackness storming
straight for the camp across the plain under the thunder
that was filling the night. A thing inconceivable
and paralyzing, till the iron grip of Berselius seized his
arm, driving him against the tree, and the voice of Berselius
cried, &#8220;Elephants.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a moment Adams was in the lower branches of the
great tree, and scarcely had he gained his position
than the sky split with the trumpeting of the charge and,
as a man dying sees his whole life with one glance, he saw
the whole camp of awakened sleepers fly like wind-blown
leaves from before the oncoming storm, leaving only two
figures remaining, the figures of Berselius and Félix.</p>
<p>The Zappo Zap had gone apart from the camp to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
sleep. He had drugged himself by smoking hemp, and
he was lying half a hundred yards away, face down on
the ground, dead to everything in earth and heaven.</p>
<p>Berselius had spied him.</p>
<p>What Adams saw then was, perhaps, the most heroic
act ever recorded of man. The soul-shattering terror of
the advancing storm, the thunder and the trumpeting that
never ceased, had no effect on the iron heart of Berselius.</p>
<p>He made the instantaneous calculation that it was
just possible to kick the man awake (for sound has no
effect on the hemp-drugged one) and get him to the tree
and a chance of safety. And he made the attempt.</p>
<p>And he would have succeeded but that he fell.</p>
<p>The root of a dead tree, whose trunk had long vanished,
caught his foot when he had made half the distance,
and brought him down flat on his face.</p>
<p>It was as though God had said, &#8220;Not so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adams, in an agony, sweat pouring from him, watched
Berselius rise to his feet. He rose slowly as if with
deliberation, and then he stood fronting the oncoming
storm. Whether he was dazed, or whether he knew that
he had miscalculated his chances, who knows? But there
he stood, as if disdaining to fly, face fronting the enemy.
And it seemed to the watcher that the figure of that man
was the figure of a god, till the storm closed on him, and
seized and swung aloft by a trunk, he was flung away like
a stone from a catapult somewhere into the night.</p>
<p>Just as a man clings to a mast in a hurricane, deaf,
blind, all his life and energy in his arms, Adams clung
to the tree bole above the branch upon which he was.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></p>
<p>The storm below, the smashing of great bodies against
the tree, the trumpeting whose prolonged scream never
ceased&mdash;all were nothing. His mind was cast out&mdash;he
had flung it away just as the elephant had flung Berselius
away. To him the universe was the tree to which
he was clinging, just that part which his arms encircled.</p>
<p>The herd had attacked in three columns, keeping the
very same formation as they had kept from the start.
The northern column, consisting of cows with their calves,
drove on as if to safety, the others, cows and bulls&mdash;the
cows even more ferocious than the bulls&mdash;attacked
the camps, the tents, and the fire. They stamped and
trod the fire out, smashing tent poles and chop boxes,
stores and cooking utensils, tusking one another in the
tight-packed <i>mêlée</i>, and the scream of the trumpeting
never ceased.</p>
<p>Then they drove on.</p>
<p>The porters, all except two, had, unhappily for themselves,
fled in a body to the west, and now mixed with
the trumpeting and thunder could be heard the screams
of men trodden under foot or tusked to pieces. These
sounds ceased, and the trumpeting died away, and nothing
could be distinguished but the dull boom, boom of
the herd sweeping away west, growing fainter and fainter,
and dying away in the night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>THE BROKEN CAMP</h3>
</div>

<p>The whole thing had scarcely lasted twenty minutes.
During the storming and trumpeting, Adams,
clinging to the tree, had felt neither terror nor
interest. His mind was cast out, all but a vestige of it;
this remnant of mind recognized that it was lying in the
open palm of Death, and it was not afraid. Not only
that, but it felt lazily triumphant. It is only the reasoning
mind that fears death, the mind that can still say to
itself, &#8220;What will come after?&#8221; The intuitive mind,
which does not reason, has no fear.</p>
<p>Had not the herd been so closely packed and so furious,
Adams would have been smelt out, plucked from the tree
and stamped to pieces without any manner of doubt.
But the elephants, jammed together, tusking each other,
and rooting the camp to pieces, had passed on, not knowing
that they had left a living man behind them.</p>
<p>As the sound of the storm died away, he came to his
senses as a man comes to his senses after the inhalation
of ether, and the first thing that was borne in upon him
was the fact that he was clinging to a tree, and that he
could not let go. His arms encircled the rough bark
like bands of iron; they had divorced themselves from his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
will power, they held him there despite himself, not from
muscular rigidity or spasm, but just because they refused
to let go. They were doing the business of clinging to
safety on their own account, and he had to <i>think himself
free</i>. There was no use in ordering them to release him,
he had to reason with them. Then, little by little, they
(fingers first) returned to discipline, and he slipped down
and came to earth, literally, for his knees gave under him
and he fell.</p>
<p>He was a very brave man and a very strong man,
but now, just released from Death, now that all danger
was over, he was very much afraid. He had seen and
heard Life: Life whipped to fury, screaming and in
maelstrom action, Life in its loudest and most appalling
phase, and he felt as a man might feel to whom the gods
had shown a near view of that tempest of fire we call
the sun.</p>
<p>He sat up and looked around him on the pitiable ruins
of the camp on which a tornado could not have wrought
more destruction. Something lay glittering in the moonlight
close to him. He picked it up. It was his shaving-glass,
the most fragile thing in all their belongings, yet
unbroken. Tent-poles had been smashed to matchwood,
cooking utensils trodden flat, guns broken to pieces;
yet this thing, useless and fragile, had been carefully
preserved, watched over by some god of its own.</p>
<p>He was dropping it from his fingers when a cry from
behind him made him turn his head.</p>
<p>A dark figure was approaching in the moonlight.</p>
<p>It was the Zappo Zap. The man whom Berselius,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
with splendid heroism, had tried to save. Like the
looking-glass, and protected, perhaps, by some god of
his own, the columns of destruction had passed him by.
The column of cows with their calves had passed him
on the other side. Old hunters say that elephants
will not trouble with a dead man, and Félix, though
awakened by the shaking of the earth, had lain like a
dead man as the storm swept by.</p>
<p>He was very much alive, now, and seemingly unconcerned
as he came toward Adams, stood beside him,
and looked around.</p>
<p>&#8220;All gone dam,&#8221; said Félix. And volumes would
not have expressed the situation more graphically. Then
the savage, having contemplated the scene for a moment,
rushed forward to a heap of stuff&mdash;broken boxes and
what not&mdash;dragged something from it and gave a shout.</p>
<p>It was the big elephant rifle, with its cartridge-bag
attached. The stock was split, but the thing was practically
intact. Félix waved it over his head and laughed
and whooped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gun!&#8221; yelled Félix.</p>
<p>Adams beckoned to him, and he came like a black devil
in the moonlight&mdash;a black devil with filed teeth and
flashing eyeballs&mdash;and Adams pointed to the tree and
motioned him to leave the gun there and follow him.
Félix obeyed, and Adams started in the direction in which
he had seen Berselius flung.</p>
<p>It was not far to walk, and they had not far to search.
A hundred yards took them to a break in the ground,
and there in the moonlight, with arms extended, lay the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
body of the once powerful Berselius, the man who had
driven them like sheep, the man whose will was law.
The man of wealth and genius, great as Lucifer in evil, yet
in courage and heroism tremendous. God-man or devil-man,
or a combination of both, but great, incontestably
great and compelling.</p>
<p>Adams knelt down beside the body, and the Zappo
Zap stood by with incurious eyes looking on.</p>
<p>Berselius was not dead. He was breathing; breathing
deeply and stertorously, as men breathe in apoplexy
or after sunstroke or ruinous injury to the brain. Adams
tore open the collar of the hunting shirt; then he examined
the limbs.</p>
<p>Berselius, flung like a stone from a catapult, had,
unfortunately for himself, not broken a limb. That
might have saved him. His head was the injured part,
and Adams, running his fingers through the hair, matted
with blood, came on the mischief. The right parietal
bone was dented very slightly for a space nearly as broad
as a penny. The skin was broken, but the bone itself,
though depressed slightly, was not destroyed. The inner
table of the skull no doubt was splintered, hence the
brain mischief.</p>
<p>There was only one thing to be done&mdash;trephine.
And that as swiftly as possible.</p>
<p>Everything needful was in the instrument-case, but
had it escaped destruction?</p>
<p>He raised Berselius by the shoulders. Félix took
the feet, and between them they carried the body to the
tree, where they laid it down.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></p>
<p>Before starting to hunt for the instruments, Adams
bled Berselius with his penknife. The effect was almost
instantaneous. The breathing became less stertorous and
laboured. Then he started to search hither and thither
for the precious mahogany case which held the amputating
knives, the tourniquets and the trephine. The Zappo
Zap was no use, as he did not know anything about the
stores, and had never even seen the instrument case,
so Adams had to conduct the search alone, in a hurry,
and over half an acre of ground. The case had almost
to a certainty been smashed to pieces; still, there was a
chance that the trephine had escaped injury. He remembered
the shaving-glass, and how it had been miraculously
preserved, and started to work. He came across a flat
oblong disc of tin; it had been a box of sardines, it was
now flattened out as though by a rolling mill. He came
across a bottle of brandy sticking jauntily up from a hole
in the ground, as if saying, &#8220;Have a drink.&#8221; It was
intact. He knocked the head off and, accepting the
dumb invitation, put it back where he had found it,
and went on.</p>
<p>He came across long strips of the green rot-proof
stuff the tents had been made of. They looked as though
they had been torn up like this for rib-roller bandages,
for they were just of that width. He came across half a
mosquito-net; the other half was sailing away north,
streaming from the tusk of a bull in which it was tangled,
and giving him, no doubt, a sufficiently bizarre appearance
under the quiet light of the moon and stars.</p>
<p>There were several chop boxes of stores intact; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
a cigar box without a crack in it, and also without a cigar.
It looked as though it had been carefully opened, emptied,
and laid down. There was no end to the surprises of this
search: things brayed to pieces as if with a pestle and
mortar, things easily smashable untouched.</p>
<p>He had been searching for two hours when he found
the trephine. It lay near the brass lock of the amputating
case, attached to which there were some pieces of mahogany
from the case itself.</p>
<p>A trephine is just like a corkscrew, only in place of
the screw you have a cup of steel. This steel cup has a
serrated edge: it is, in fact, a small circular saw. Applying
the saw edge to the bone, and working the handle
with half turns of the wrist, you can remove a disc from
the outer table of the skull just as a cook stamps cakes
out of a sheet of dough with a &#8220;cutter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adams looked at the thing in his hands; the cup of
chilled steel, thin as paper and brittle as glass, had been
smashed to pieces, presumably; at all events, it was not
there.</p>
<p>He flung the handle and the shaft away and came back
to the tree beneath which the body of Berselius was
lying. Berselius, still senseless, was breathing deeply
and slowly, and Adams, having cut away the hair of the
scalp round the wound with his penknife, went to the
pool for water to bathe the wound; but the pool was
trodden up into slush, and hours must elapse before the
mud would settle. He remembered the bottle of brandy,
fetched it, washed the wound with brandy, and with
his handkerchief torn into three pieces bound it up.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>There was nothing more to be done; and he sat down
with his back to the tree to wait for dawn.</p>
<p>The bitterness of the thing was in his heart, the bitterness
of being there with hands willing and able to help,
yet helpless. A surgeon is as useless without his instruments
as the cold, lifeless instruments are without a hand
to guide them. It is not his fault that his hands are tied,
but if he is a man of any feeling, that does not lessen the
anguish of the situation.</p>
<p>Adams, listening to the breathing of the man he could
not save, sat watching the moonlit desert where the grass
waved in the wind. Félix, lying on his belly, had resumed
his slumbers, and beside the sleeping savage lay the thing
he worshipped more than his god, the big elephant rifle,
across the stock of which his naked arm was flung.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>THE FEAST OF THE VULTURES</h3>
</div>

<p>Adams, who had fallen asleep, was awakened by a
whoop from Félix.</p>
<p>It was full, blazing day, and the Zappo Zap,
standing erect just as he had sprung from sleep, was staring
with wrinkled eyes straight out across the land. Two
black figures were approaching. They were the two porters
who had fled westward, and who, with Félix, were
all that remained of Berselius&#8217;s savage train of followers.
The rest were over there&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Over there to the west, where vultures and marabouts
and kites were holding a clamorous meeting; over there,
where the ground was black with birds.</p>
<p>The two wretches approaching the camping place
rolled their eyes in terror, glancing over there. They
had run for miles and hidden themselves in a donga.
They had heard the tragedy from afar, the storming and
trumpeting, and the shrieks of men being destroyed,
torn to pieces, trampled to pulp; they had heard the thunder
of the vanishing herd, and they had listened to the
awful silence that followed, lying on their faces, clinging
to the breast of their old, cold, cruel Mother Earth. With
day, like homing pigeons, they had returned to the camp.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hi yi!&#8221; yelled Félix, and a response came like the
cry of a seagull. They were shivering as dogs shiver
when ill or frightened; their teeth were chattering, and
they had a curious gray, dusky look; the very oil of their
skins seemed to have dried up, and old chain scars on
their necks and ankles showed white and leprous-looking
in the bright morning sunshine.</p>
<p>But Adams had no time to attend to them. Having
glanced in their direction, he turned to Berselius, bent
over him, and started back in surprise.</p>
<p>Berselius&#8217;s eyes were open; he was breathing regularly
and slowly, and he looked like a man who, just awakened
from sleep, was yet too lazy to move.</p>
<p>Adams touched him upon the shoulder, and Berselius,
raising his right hand, drew it over his face as if to chase
away sleep. Then his head dropped, and he lay looking
up at the sky. Then he yawned twice, deeply, and turning
his head on his left shoulder looked about him lazily,
his eyes resting here and there: on the two porters who
were sitting, with knees drawn up, eating some food which
Félix had given them; on the broken camp furniture
and the heaps of raffle left by the catastrophe of the
night before; on the skyline where the grass waved against
the morning blue.</p>
<p>Adams heaved a sigh of relief. The man had only
been stunned. None of the vital centres of the brain
had been injured. Some injury there must be, but the
main springs of life were intact. There was no paralysis,
for now the sick man was raising his left hand, and,
moving about as a person moves in bed to get a more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
comfortable position, he raised both knees and then,
turning over on his right side, straightened them out again.
Now, by the movements of a sick person you can tell
pretty nearly the condition of his brain.</p>
<p>All the movements of this sick man were normal;
they indicated great tiredness, nothing more. The shock
and the loss of blood might account for that. Adams
the night before had made a pillow from his own coat for
the stricken one&#8217;s head; he was bending now to rearrange
it, but he desisted. Berselius was asleep.</p>
<p>Adams remained on his knees for a moment contemplating
his patient with deep satisfaction. Then he rose
to his feet. Some shelter must be improvised to protect
the sleeping man from the sun, but in the raffle around
there did not seem enough tent cloth to make even an
umbrella.</p>
<p>Calling Félix and the two porters to follow him, he
started off, searching amidst the <i>débris</i> here and there,
setting the porters to work to collect the remains of the
stores and to bring them back to the tree, hunting in vain
for what he wanted, till Félix, just as they reached the
northern limit of destruction, pointed to where the birds
were still busy, clamorous and gorging.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Adams.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tent,&#8221; replied Félix.</p>
<p>To the left of where the birds were, and close to them,
lay a mound of something showing dark amidst the grass.
It was a tent, or a large part of one of the tents; tangled,
perhaps, in a tusk, it had been brought here and cast, just
as a storm might have brought and cast it. Even at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
this distance the air was tainted with the odour of the
birds and their prey, but the thing had to be fetched,
and Adams was not the man to exhibit qualms before
a savage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; said he, and they started.</p>
<p>The birds saw them coming, and some flew away;
others, trying to fly away, rose in the air heavily and
fluttering a hundred yards sank and scattered about in
the grass, looking like great vermin; a few remained
waddling here and there, either too impudent for flight
or too greatly gorged.</p>
<p>Truly it had been a great killing, and the ground was
ripped as if by ploughs. Over a hundred square yards
lay blistering beneath the sun, red and blue and black;
and the torment of it pierced the silence like a shout,
though not a movement was there, save the movement of
the bald-headed vulture as he waddled, or the flapping of
a rag of skin to the breeze.</p>
<p>They seized on the tent, the Zappo Zap laughing and
with teeth glinting in the sun. It was the smallest tent,
ripped here and there, but otherwise sound; the mosquito
net inside was intact and rolled up like a ball, but the
pole was broken in two.</p>
<p>As they carried it between them, they had to pass near
a man. He was very dead, that man; a great foot had
trodden on his face, and it was flattened out, looking like
a great black flat-fish in which a child, for fun, had
punched holes for eyes and mouth and nose; it was curling
up at the edges under the sun&#8217;s rays, becoming
converted into a cup.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>&#8220;B&#8217;selius,&#8221; said Félix, with a laugh, indicating this
thing as they passed it.</p>
<p>Adams had his hands full, or he would have struck
the brute to the ground. He contented himself with
driving the tent pole into the small of his back to urge
him forward. From that moment he conceived a hatred
for Félix such as few men have felt, for it was not a hatred
against a man, or even a brute, but a black automatic
figure with filed teeth, a thing with the brain and heart
of an alligator, yet fashioned after God&#8217;s own image.</p>
<p>A hatred for Félix, and a pity for Berselius.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>THE LOST GUIDE</h3>
</div>

<p>They improvised a shelter against the tree with the
tent cloth over the sleeping man, and then Adams
set Félix to work splicing and mending the tent
pole. The two porters, who had stuffed themselves with
food, were looking better and a shade more human;
the glossy look was coming back to their skins and the
fright was leaving their faces. He set them to work,
piling the recovered stores in the bit of shade cast by the
tree and the improvised tent, and as they did so he took
toll of the stuff.</p>
<p>He judged that there was enough provisions to take
them back along the road they had come by. The hunt
was ended. Even should Berselius recover fully in a
couple of days, Adams determined to insist on a return.
But he did not expect any resistance.</p>
<p>It was a long, long, wearisome day. The great far-stretching
land, voiceless except just over there where
birds were still busy and would be busy till all was gone;
the cloudless sky, and the shifting shadow of the
tree; these were the best company he had. The blacks
were not companions. The two porters seemed less
human than dogs, and Félix poisoned his sight.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>His dislike for this man had been steadily growing.
The thought that Berselius had risked his life for this
creature, and the remembrance of how he had pointed to
the dead man with a grin and said &#8220;B&#8217;selius,&#8221; had brought
matters to a head in the mind of Adams, and turned his
dislike into a furious antipathy. He sat now in what
little shadow there was, watching the figure of the
Zappo Zap.</p>
<p>Félix, the tent-pole finished, had slunk off westward,
hunting about, or pretending to hunt for salvage. Little
by little the black figure dwindled till it reached where
the birds were discoursing and clamouring, and Adams
felt his blood grow cold as he watched the birds rise like
a puff of black smoke and scatter, some this way, some
that; some flying right away, some settling down near by.</p>
<p>The black figure, a tiny sketch against the sky, wandered
hither and thither, and then vanished.</p>
<p>Félix had sat him down.</p>
<p>Adams rose up and took the elephant rifle, took from
the bag a great solid drawn brass cartridge, loaded the
rifle, and sat down again in the shade.</p>
<p>Berselius was sleeping peacefully. He could hear the
even respirations through the tent cloth. The porters
were sleeping in the sun as only niggers can sleep when
they are tired; but Adams was feeling as if he could never
sleep again, as he sat waiting and watching and listening
to the faint whisper, whisper of the grass as the wind bent
it gently in its passage.</p>
<p>A long time passed, and then the black sketch appeared
again outlined on the sky. It grew in size, and as it grew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
Adams fingered the triggers of the gun, and his lips became
as dry as sand, so that he had to lick them and keep on
licking them, till his tongue became dry as his lips and his
palate dry as his tongue.</p>
<p>Then he rose up, rifle in hand, for the Zappo Zap had
come to speaking distance. Adams advanced to meet
him. There was a dry, dull glaze about the creature&#8217;s
lips and chin that told a horrible story, and at the sight
of it the white man halted dead, pointed away to
where the birds were again congregating, cried &#8220;Gr-r-r,&#8221;
as a man cries to a dog that has misbehaved, and flung
the rifle to his shoulder.</p>
<p>Félix broke away and ran. Ran, striking eastward,
and bounding as a buck antelope bounds with a leopard
at its heels, whilst the ear-shattering report of the great
rifle rang across the land and a puff of white dust broke
from the ground near the black bounding figure. Adams,
cursing himself for having missed, grounded the gun-butt
and stood watching the dot in the distance till it
vanished from sight.</p>
<p>He had forgotten the fact that Félix was the guide
and that without him the return would be a hazardous
one; but had he remembered this, it would have made
no difference. Better to die in the desert twenty times
over than to return escorted by <i>that</i>.</p>
<p>It was now getting toward sundown. The great
elephant country in which the camp lay lost had, during
the daytime, three phases. Three spirits presided
over this place; the spirit of morning, of noon, and of
evening.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
In towns and cities, even in the open country of civilized
lands, these three are clad in language and bound in
chains of convention, reduced to slaves whose task is to
call men to rise, to eat, or sleep. But here, in this vast
place, one saw them naked&mdash;naked and free as when
they caught the world&#8217;s first day, like a new-minted
coin struck from darkness, and spun it behind them
into night.</p>
<p>Under the presidency of these three spirits the land
was ever changing; the country of the morning was not
the country of the noon, nor was the country of the
noon the country of the evening.</p>
<p>The morning was loud. I can express it in no other
terms. Dawn came like a blast of trumpets, driving
the flocks of the red flamingoes before it, tremendous, and
shattering the night of stars at the first fanfare. A
moment later, and, changing the image, imagination
could hear the sea of light bursting against the far edge of
the horizon, even as you watched the spindrift of it surging
up to heaven and the waves of it breaking over ridge
and tree and plain of waving grass.</p>
<p>Noon was the hour of silence. Under the pyramid
of light the land lay speechless, without a shadow except
the shadow of the flying bird, or a sound except the sigh
of the grass, touched and bent by the wind, if it blew.</p>
<p>Evening brought with it a new country. There was
no dusk here, no beauties of twilight, but the level light
of sunset brought a beauty of its own. Distance stood
over the land, casting trees farther away, and spreading
the prairies of grass with her magic.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></p>
<p>The country, now, had a new population. The
shadows. Nowhere else, perhaps, do shadows grow and
live as here, where the atmosphere and the level light of
evening combine to form the quaintest shadows on earth.
The giraffe has for his counterpart a set of shadow legs
ten yards long, and the elephant in his shadow state goes
on stilts. A man is followed by a pair of black compasses,
and a squat tent flings to the east the shadow of
a sword.</p>
<p>Adams was sitting looking at the two porters whom
he had set to hunt for firewood; he was watching their
grotesque figures, and more than grotesque shadows,
when a movement of the sick man under the tent-cloth
caused him to turn.</p>
<p>Berselius had awakened. More than that, he was
sitting up, and before Adams could put up a hand, the
tent-cloth was flung back, and the head and shoulders
of the sick man appeared.</p>
<p>His face was pale, his hair in disorder; but his consciousness
had fully returned. He recognized Adams
with a glance, and then, without speaking, struggled
to free himself of the tent-cloth and get on his feet.</p>
<p>Adams helped him.</p>
<p>Berselius, leaning on the arm of his companion, looked
around him, and then stood looking at the setting sun.</p>
<p>The glorious day was very near its end. The sun
huge and half-shorn of his beams, was sinking slowly,
inevitably; scarce two diameters divided his lower edge
from the horizon that was thirsting for him as the grave
thirsts for man. Thus fades, shorn of its dazzle and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
splendour, the intellect so triumphant at noon, the personality,
the compelling will; the man himself when night
has touched him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you better?&#8221; asked Adams.</p>
<p>Berselius made no reply.</p>
<p>Like a child, held by some glittering bauble, he seemed
fascinated by the sun. The western sky was marked
by a thin reef of cloud; dull gold, it momentarily brightened
to burnished gold, and then to fire.</p>
<p>The sun touched the horizon. Ere one could say
&#8220;Look!&#8221; he was half gone. The blazing arc of his upper
limb hung for a moment palpitating, then it dwindled
to a point, vanished, and a wave of twilight, like the
shadow of a wing, passed over the land.</p>
<p>As Berselius, leaning on the arm of his companion,
turned, it was already night.</p>
<p>The camp fire which the porters had lit was crackling,
and Berselius, helped by his friend, sat down with his
back to the tree and his face toward the fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you better?&#8221; asked Adams, as he took a seat
beside him and proceeded to light a pipe.</p>
<p>&#8220;My head,&#8221; said Berselius. As he spoke he put
his hand to his head as a person puts his hand to his
forehead when he is dazed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any pain?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no pain, but there is a mist.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can see all right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, I can see. It is not my sight, but there is
a mist&mdash;in my head.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adams guessed what he meant. The man&#8217;s mind had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
been literally shaken up. He knew, too, that thought
and mental excitement were the worst things for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think about it,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It will pass. You
have had a knock on the head. Just lean back against
the tree, for I want to dress the wound.&#8221;</p>
<p>He undid the bandage, fetched some water from the
pool, which was now clear, and set to work. The wound
was healthy and seemed much less severe than it had
seemed the night before. The dent in the bone seemed
quite inconsiderable. The inner table of the skull might,
after all, be not injured. One thing was certain: whatever
mischief the cortex of the brain had suffered, the prime
centres had escaped. Speech and movement were perfect
and thought was rational.</p>
<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; said Adams, when he had finished his dressings
and taken his seat, &#8220;you are all right now. But
don&#8217;t talk or do any thinking. The mist, as you call it,
in your head will pass away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see,&#8221; said Berselius; then he stopped, hesitated,
and went on&mdash;&#8220;I can see last night&mdash;I can see us all
here by the camp fire, but beyond that I cannot see, for
a great white mist hides everything. And still&#8221;&mdash;he
burst out&mdash;&#8220;I seem to know everything hidden by that
mist, but I can&#8217;t see, I can&#8217;t see. What is this thing that
has happened to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know your name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, my name is Berselius, just as your name is Adams.
My mind is clear, my memory is clear, but I have lost the
sight of memory. Beyond the camp fire of last night,
everything is a thick mist&mdash;I am afraid!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>He took Adams&#8217;s big hand, and the big man gulped
suddenly at the words and the action.</p>
<p>The great Berselius afraid! The man who had faced
the elephants, the man who cared not a halfpenny for
death, the man who was so far above the stature of other
men, sitting there beside him and holding his hand like
a little child, and saying, &#8220;I am afraid!&#8221;</p>
<p>And the voice of Berselius was not the voice of the
Berselius of yesterday. It had lost the decision and commanding
tone that made it so different from the voices of
common men.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will pass,&#8221; said Adams. &#8220;It is only a shake-up
of the brain. Why, I have seen a man after a blow on
the head with his memory clean wiped out. He had to
learn his alphabet again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berselius did not reply. His head was nodding forward
in sleep. He had slept all day, but sleep had taken
him again suddenly, just as it takes a child, and Adams
placed him under the improvised tent with the coat for
a pillow under his head, and then sat by the fire.</p>
<p>Memory of all things in this wonderful world is surely
the most wonderful. It is there now, and the next
moment it is not. You leave your house in London, and
you are next found in Brighton, sane to all intents and
purposes, but your memory is gone. A dense fog hides
everything you have ever done, dreamed or spoken.
You may have committed crimes in your past life, or you
may have been a saint. It is all the same, for the moment,
until the mist breaks up and your past reappears.</p>
<p>Berselius&#8217;s case was a phase of this condition. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
knew his name&mdash;everything lay before his mind up to
a certain point. Beyond that, he knew all sorts of things
were lying, but he could not see them. To use his own
eloquent expression, he had lost the sight of memory.</p>
<p>If you recall your past, it comes in pictures. You
have to ransack a great photographic gallery. Before
you can think, you must see.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>BEYOND THE SKYLINE</h3>
</div>

<p>Adams, wearied to death with the events of the
past day and night, slept by the camp fire the
deep dreamless sleep of utter exhaustion. He
had piled the fire with wood, using broken boxes, slow-burning
vangueria brushwood, and the remains of a
ruined mimosa tree that lay a hundred yards from the
camp, and he lay by it now as soundly asleep as the two
porters and Berselius. The fire stood guard; crackling
and flickering beneath the stars, it showed a burning spark
that made the camping place determinable many miles
away.</p>
<p>Now the Zappo Zap, when he had fled from Adams,
put ten miles of country behind him, going almost with
the swiftness of an antelope, taking low bush and broken
ground in his stride, and halting only when instinct brought
him to a stand, saying, &#8220;You are safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>He knew the country well, and the thirty miles that
separated him from the eastern forest, where he could
obtain food and shelter, were nothing to him. He could
have run nearly the whole distance and reached there in
a few hours&#8217; time.</p>
<p>But time was also nothing to him. He had fed well,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
and could last two days without food. It was not his
intention to desert the camp yet; for at the camp, under
that tree away to the west, lay a thing that he lusted
after as men lust for drink or love: the desire of his dark
soul&mdash;the elephant gun.</p>
<p>Before Adams drove him away from the camp he had
made up his mind to steal it. Sneak off with it in the
night and vanish with it into his own country away to the
northeast, leaving B&#8217;selius and his broken camp to fend
for themselves. This determination was still unshaken;
the thing held him like a charm, and he sat down, squatting
in the grass with his knees drawn up to his chin and
his eyes fixed westward, waiting for evening.</p>
<p>An hour before sunset he made for the camp, reaching
within a mile of it as the light left the sky. He watched
the camp fire burning, and made for it. Toward midnight,
crawling on his belly, soundless as a snake, he
crept right up beside Adams, seized the gun and the
cartridge bag, and with them in his hands stood erect.</p>
<p>He had no fear now. He knew he could outrun anyone
there. He held the gun by the barrels. Adams&#8217;s
white face, as he lay with mouth open, snoring and
deep in slumber, presented an irresistible mark for the
heavy gun-butt, and all would have been over with that
sleeper in this world, had not the attention of the savage
been drawn to an object that suddenly appeared from
beneath the folds of the improvised tent.</p>
<p>It was the hand of Berselius.</p>
<p>Berselius, moving uneasily in his sleep, had flung out
his arm; the clenched fist, like the emblem of power,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
struck the eye of the Zappo Zap, and quelled him as the
sight of the whip quells a dog.</p>
<p>B&#8217;selius was alive and able to clench his fist. That fact
was enough for Félix, and next moment he was gone,
and the moonlight cast his black shadow as he ran, making
northeast, a darkness let loose on life and on the land.</p>
<p>Adams awoke at sun-up to find the gun and the cartridge
bag gone. The porters knew nothing. He had
picked up enough of their language to interrogate them,
but they could only shake their heads, and he was debating
in his own mind whether he ought to kick them on
principle, when Berselius made his appearance from the
tent.</p>
<p>His strength had come back to him. The dazed look
of the day before had left his face, but the expression
of the face was altered. The half smile which had been
such a peculiar feature of his countenance was no longer
there. The level eye that raised to no man and lowered
before no man, the aspect of command and the ease of
perfect control and power&mdash;where were they?</p>
<p>Adams, as he looked at his companion, felt a pang such
as we feel when we see a human being suddenly and
terribly mutilated.</p>
<p>Who has not known a friend who, from an accident
in the hunting field, the shock of a railway collision, or
some great grief, has suddenly changed; of whom people
say, &#8220;Ah, yes, since the accident he has never been the
same man&#8221;?</p>
<p>A friend who yesterday was hale and hearty, full of
will power and brain, and who to-day is a different person
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
with drooping under-lip, lack-lustre eye, and bearing
in every movement the indecision which marks the
inferior mind.</p>
<p>Berselius&#8217;s under-lip did not droop, nor did his manner
lack the ordinary decision of a healthy man; the change
in him was slight, but it was startlingly evident. So
high had Nature placed him above other men, that a
crack in the pedestal was noticeable; as to the injury
to the statue itself, the ladder of time would be required
before that could be fully discovered.</p>
<p>So far from being downcast this morning, Berselius
was mildly cheerful. He washed and had his wound
dressed, and then sat down to a miserable breakfast of
cold tinned meat and cassava cakes, with water fetched
from the pool in a cracked calabash.</p>
<p>He said nothing about the mist in his head, and Adams
carefully avoided touching on the question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sleep has put him all right,&#8221; said Adams to himself.
&#8220;All the same, he&#8217;s not the man he was. He&#8217;s a dozen
times more human and like other men. Wonder how
long it will last. Just as long as he&#8217;s feeling sick, I
expect.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose to fetch his pipe when Berselius, who had
finished eating and had also risen to his feet, beckoned
him to come close.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the road we came by?&#8221; said Berselius, pointing
over the country toward the west.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Adams, &#8220;that is the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you see the skyline?&#8221; said Berselius.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I see the skyline.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, my memory carries me to the skyline, but not
beyond.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Lord!&#8221; said Adams to himself, &#8220;here he is beginning
it all over again!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can remember,&#8221; said Berselius, &#8220;everything that
happened as far as my eye carries me. For instance,
by that tree a mile away a porter fell down. He was
very exhausted. And when we had passed that ridge
near the skyline we saw two birds fighting; two bald-headed
vultures&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is so,&#8221; said Adams.</p>
<p>&#8220;But beyond the skyline,&#8221; said Berselius, suddenly
becoming excited and clutching his companion&#8217;s arm,
&#8220;I see nothing. I know nothing. All is mist&mdash;all
is mist.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said the surgeon. &#8220;It&#8217;s only memory
blindness. It will come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, but will it? If I can get to the skyline and see
the country beyond, and if I remember that, and if I go
on and on, the way we came, and if I remember as I go,
then, then, I will be saved. But if I get to that skyline
and if I find that the mist stops me from seeing beyond,
then I pray you kill me, for the agony of this thing is not
to be borne.&#8221; Suddenly he ceased, and then, as if to some
unseen person, he cried out&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have left my memory on that road.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adams, frightened at the man&#8217;s agitation, tried to
soothe him, but Berselius, in the grip of this awful desire
to pierce back beyond that mist and find himself, would
not be soothed. Nothing would satisfy him but to strike
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
camp and return along the road they had come by. Some
instinct told him that the sight of the things he had seen
would wake up memory, and that bit by bit, as he went,
the mist would retreat before him, and perhaps vanish
at last. Some instinct told him this, but reason, who is
ever a doubter, tortured him with doubts.</p>
<p>The only course was to go back and see. Adams,
who doubted if his patient was physically fit for a march,
at last gave in; the man&#8217;s agony of mind was more dangerous
to him than the exhaustion of physical exercise
could prove. He gave orders to the porters to strike camp,
and then turned to himself, and helped them. They
only carried what was barely needful, and was even less
than needful, to take them to Fort M&#8217;Bassa, ten days,
journey in Berselius&#8217;s condition. Four water bottles
that had been left intact they filled with water; they took
the tent, and the pole that Félix had spliced. Cassava
cakes and tinned meat and a few pounds of chocolate
made up the provisions. There were no guns to carry,
no trophies of the chase. Of all the army of porters only
two were left. Berselius was broken down, Félix had
fled, they had no guide, and the crowning horror of the
thing was that they had struck off in pursuit of the herd
at right angles to the straight path they had taken from
the forest, and Adams did not know in the least the point
where they had struck off. The porters were absolutely
no use as guides, and unless God sent a guide from
heaven or chance interposed to lead them in the right
way, they were lost; for they had no guns or ammunition
with which to get food.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>Truly the omen of the elephant lying down had not
spoken in vain.</p>
<p>When all was loaded up, and Adams was loaded even
like the porters, they turned their backs on the tree
and the pools, and leaving them there to burn in the
sun forever struck straight west in the direction from
which they had come.</p>
<p>Berselius had come in pursuit of a terrible thing and
a merciless thing; he was returning in search of a more
terrible and a more merciless thing&mdash;Memory.</p>
<p>It was four hours after sun-up when they left the camp;
and two hours&#8217; march brought them to that ridge which
Berselius had indicated from the camp as being near the
skyline.</p>
<p>When they reached the ridge, and not before, Berselius
halted and stared over the country in front of him,
his face filled with triumph and hope.</p>
<p>He seized Adams&#8217;s hand and pointed away to the west.
The ridge gave a big view of the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can remember all that,&#8221; said he, &#8220;keenly, right
up to the skyline.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And at the skyline?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stands the mist,&#8221; replied Berselius. &#8220;But it will
lift before me as I go on. Now I know it is only the
sight of the things I have seen that is needful to recall the
memory of them and of myself in connection with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adams said nothing. It struck him with an eerie
feeling that this man beside him was actually walking
back into his past. As veil after veil of distance was
raised, so would the past come back, bit by bit.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>But he was yet to learn what a terrible journey that
would be.</p>
<p>One thing struck him as strange. Berselius had
never tried to pierce the mist by questions. The man
seemed entirely obsessed by the curtain of mist, and
by the necessity of piercing it by physical movement,
of putting tree to tree and mile to mile.</p>
<p>Berselius had not asked questions because, no doubt,
he was under the dominion of a profound instinct, telling
him that the past he had lost could only be recalled
by the actual picture of the things he had seen.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>THE SENTENCE OF THE DESERT</h3>
</div>

<p>Berselius had not asked a single question as
to the catastrophe. His own misfortune had
banished for him, doubtless, all interest in everything
else.</p>
<p>Adams had said to him nothing of Félix, his horrible
deeds or his theft of the rifle. Félix, though he had
vanished from Adams&#8217;s life completely and forever, had
not vanished from the face of the earth. He was very
much alive and doing, and his deeds and his fate are worth
a word, for they formed a tragedy well fitting the stage
of this merciless land.</p>
<p>The Zappo Zap, having secured the gun and its ammunition,
revelling in the joy of possession and power,
went skipping on his road, which lay to the northeast.
Six miles from the camp he flung himself down by a
bush, and, with the gun covered by his arm, slept, and
hunted in his sleep, like a hound, till dawn.</p>
<p>Then he rose and pursued his way, still travelling
northeast, his bird-like eyes skimming the land and
horizon. He sang as he pursued his way, and his song
fitted his filed teeth to a charm. If a poisoned arrow
could sing or a stabbing spear, it would sing what Félix
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
sang as he went, his long morning shadow stalking
behind him; he as soulless and as heartless as it.</p>
<p>What motive of attachment had driven him to follow
Verhaeren to Yandjali from the Bena Pianga country
heaven knows, for the man was quite beyond the human
pale. The elephants were far, far above him in power
of love and kindness; one had to descend straight to the
alligators to match him, and even then one found oneself
at fault.</p>
<p>He was not. Those three words alone describe this
figure of india-rubber that could still walk and talk and
live and lust, and to whom slaying and torture were
amongst the æsthetics of life.</p>
<p>An hour before noon, beyond and above a clump of
trees, he sighted a moving object. It was the head of
a giraffe.</p>
<p>It was the very same bull giraffe that had fled with
the elephant herd and then wheeled away south from it.
It was wandering devious now, feeding by itself, and the
instant Félix saw the tell-tale head, he dropped flat to the
ground as if he had been shot. The giraffe had not seen
him, for the head, having vanished for a moment,
reappeared; it was feeding, plucking down small branches
of leaves, and Félix, lying on his side, opened the breech
of the rifle, drew the empty cartridge case, inserted a
cartridge in each barrel, and closed the breech. Now,
unknown to Adams, when he had fired the gun the day
before, there was a plug of clay in the left-hand barrel
about two inches from the muzzle; just an inconsiderable
wad of clay about as thick as a gun wad; the elephant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
folk had done this when they had mishandled the gun,
and, though the thing could have been removed with a
twig, Puck himself could not have conceived a more
mischievous obstruction. He certainly never would
have conceived so devilish a one.</p>
<p>Adams had, fortunately for himself, fired the right-hand
barrel; the concussion had not broken up the plug,
for it was still moist, being clay from the trodden-up edge
of the pool. It was moist still, for the night dew had
found it.</p>
<p>The Zappo Zap knew nothing of the plug. He knew
nothing, either, of the tricks of these big, old-fashioned
elephant guns, for he kept both barrels full cock, and it is
almost three to two that if you fire one of these rifles
with both barrels full cock, both barrels will go off
simultaneously, or nearly so, from the concussion.</p>
<p>With the gun trailing after him&mdash;another foolish
trick&mdash;the savage crawled on his belly through the long
grass to within firing distance of the tree clump.</p>
<p>Then he lay and waited.</p>
<p>He had not long to wait.</p>
<p>The giraffe, hungry and feeding, was straying along
the edge of the clump of trees, picking down the youngest
and freshest leaves, just as a <i>gourmet</i> picks the best bits
out of a salad.</p>
<p>In a few minutes his body was in view, the endless
neck flung up, the absurd head and little, stumpy, useless
horns prying amidst the leaves, and every now and
then slewing round and sweeping the country in search
of danger.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>Félix lay motionless as a log; then, during a moment
when the giraffe&#8217;s head was hidden in the leaves, he
flung himself into position and took aim.</p>
<p>A tremendous report rang out, the giraffe fell, squealing,
and roaring and kicking, and Félix, flung on his back,
lay stretched out, a cloud of gauzy blue smoke in the air
above him.</p>
<p>The breech of the rifle had blown out. He had fired
the right-hand barrel, but the concussion had sprung
the left-hand cock as well.</p>
<p>It seemed to the savage that a great black hand struck
him in the face and flung him backward. He lay for
a moment, half-stunned; then he sat up, and, behold!
the sun had gone out and he was in perfect blackness.</p>
<p>He was blind, for his eyes were gone, and where his
nose had been was now a cavity. He looked as though
he had put on a red velvet domino, and he sat there in the
sun with the last vestige of the blue smoke dissolving
above him in the air, not knowing in the least what had
happened to him.</p>
<p>He knew nothing of blindness; he knew little of pain.
An Englishman in his wounded state would have been
screaming in agony; to Félix the pain was sharp, but
it was nothing to the fact that the sun had &#8220;gone down.&#8221;</p>
<p>He put his hand to the pain and felt his ruined face,
but that did not tell him anything.</p>
<p>This sudden black dark was not the darkness which
came from shutting one&#8217;s eyes; it was something else,
and he scrambled on his feet to find out.</p>
<p>He could feel the darkness now, and he advanced a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
few steps to see if he could walk through it; then he
sprang into the air to see if it was lighter above, and
dived on his hands and knees to see if he could slip under
it, and shouted and whooped to see if he could drive it
away.</p>
<p>But it was a great darkness, not to be out-jumped,
jumped he as high as the sun, or slipped under, were
he as thin as a knife, or whooped away, though he
whooped to everlasting.</p>
<p>He walked rapidly, and then he began to run. He
ran rapidly, and he seemed to possess some instinct in his
feet which told him of broken ground. The burst gun
lay where he had left it in the grass, and the dead giraffe
lay where it had fallen by the trees; the wind blew, and
the grass waved, the sun spread his pyramid of light
from horizon to horizon, and in the sparkle above a black
dot hung trembling above the stricken beast at the edge
of the wood.</p>
<p>The black figure of the man continued its headlong
course. It was running in a circle of many miles, impelled
through the nothingness of night by the dark soul raging
in it.</p>
<p>Hours passed, and <i>then</i> it fell, and lay face to the sky
and arms outspread. You might have thought it dead.
But it was a thing almost indestructible. It lay motionless,
but it was alive with hunger.</p>
<p>During all its gyrations it had been followed and
watched closely. It had not lain for a minute when a
vulture dropped like a stone from the sky and lit on it
with wings outspread.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></p>
<p>Next moment the vulture was seized, screeching, torn
limb from limb, and in the act of being devoured!</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>But the sentence of the desert on the blind is death,
trap vultures as cunningly as you will, and devour them
as ferociously. The eye is everything in the battle of
the strong against the weak. And so it came about that
two days later a pair of leopards from the woods to the
northeast fought with the figure, which fought with
teeth and hands and feet, whilst the yellow-eyed kites
looked on at a battle that would have turned with horror
the heart of Flamininus.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>TOWARD THE SUNSET</h3>
</div>

<p>When Berselius, standing on the ridge, had
looked long enough at the country before
him, taking in its every detail with delight,
they started again on their march, Berselius leading.</p>
<p>They had no guide. The only plan in Adams&#8217;s head
was to march straight west toward the sunset for a distance
roughly equivalent to the forced march they had
made in pursuit of the herd, and then to strike at right
angles due north and try to strike the wood isthmus of
the two great forests making up the forest of M&#8217;Bonga.</p>
<p>But the sunset is a wide mark and only appears at
sunset. They had no compass; the elephant folk had
made away with all the instruments of the expedition.
They must inevitably stray from the true direction, striking
into that infernal circle which imprisons all things
blind and all things compassless. Even should they, by
a miracle, strike the isthmus of woods, the forest would
take them, confuse them, hand them from tree to tree
and glade to glade, and lose them at last and for ever
in one of the million pockets which a forest holds open
for the lost.</p>
<p>The stout heart of the big man had not quailed before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
this prospect. He had a fighting chance; that was
enough for him. But now at the re-start, as Berselius
stepped forward and took the lead, a hope sprang up in
his breast. A tremendous and joyful idea occurred to
him. Was it possible that Berselius would guide them
back?</p>
<p>The memory that the man possessed was so keen, his
anxiety to pierce the veil before him was so overpowering,
was it possible that like a hound hunting by sight instead
of smell, he would lead them straight?</p>
<p>Only by following the exact track they had come by,
could Berselius pierce back into that past he craved to see.
Only by putting tree to tree and ridge to ridge, memory
to memory, could he collect what he had lost.</p>
<p>Could he do this?</p>
<p>The life of the whole party depended upon the answer
to that question.</p>
<p>The track they ought to follow was the track by which
the herd had led them. Adams could not tell whether
they were following that track&mdash;even Félix could scarcely
have told&mdash;for the dew and the wind had made the faint
traces of the elephants quite indiscernible now to civilized
eyes; and Berselius never once looked at the ground under
his feet, he was led entirely by the configuration of the
land. That to the eyes of Adams was hopeless. For
the great elephant country is all alike, and one ridge is
the counterpart of another ridge, and one grassy plain
of another grassy plain, and the scattered trees tell you
nothing when you are lost, except that you are lost.</p>
<p>The heat of the day was now strong on the land; the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
porters sweated under their loads, and Adams, loaded
like them, knew for once in his life what it was to be a
slave and a beast of burden.</p>
<p>Berselius, who carried nothing, did not seem to feel
the heat; weak though he must have been from his injury
and the blood-letting. He marched on, ever on, apparently
satisfied and well pleased as horizon lifted, giving place
to new horizon, and plain of waving grass succeeded
ridge of broken ground.</p>
<p>But Adams, as hour followed hour, felt the hope dying
out in his breast, and the remorseless certainty stole upon
him that they were out of their track. This land seemed
somehow different from any he had seen before; he could
have sworn that this country around them was not the
country through which they had pursued the herd. His
hope had been built on a false foundation. How could a
man whose memory was almost entirely obscured
lead them right? This was not the case of the blind
leading the blind, but the case of the blind leading men
with sight.</p>
<p>Berselius was deceiving himself. Hope was leading
him, not memory.</p>
<p>And still Berselius led on, assured and triumphant,
calling out, &#8220;See! do you remember that tree? We
passed it at just this distance when we were coming.&#8221;
Or, now, &#8220;Look at that patch of blue grass. We halted
for a minute here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adams, after a while, made no reply. The assurance
and delight of Berselius as these fancied memories came
to him shocked the heart. There was a horrible and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
sardonic humour in the whole business, a bathos that
insulted the soul.</p>
<p>The dead leading the living, the blind leading the
man with sight, lunacy leading sanity to death.</p>
<p>Yet there was nothing to be done but follow. As
well take Berselius&#8217;s road as any other. Sunset would
tell them whether they were facing the sunset; but he
wished that Berselius would cease.</p>
<p>The situation was bad enough to bear without those
triumphant calls.</p>
<p>It was past noon now; the light wind that had been
blowing in their faces had died away; there was the faintest
stirring of the air, and on this, suddenly, to Adams&#8217;s
nostrils came stealing a smell of corruption, such as he
had never experienced before.</p>
<p>It grew stronger as they went.</p>
<p>There was a slight rise in the ground before them just
here, and as they took it the stench became almost insupportable,
and Adams was turning aside to spit when a cry
from Berselius, who was a few yards in advance, brought
him forward to his side.</p>
<p>The rise in the ground had hidden from them a dried-up
river-bed, and there before them in the sandy trough, huge
amidst the boulders, lay the body of an elephant.</p>
<p>A crowd of birds busy about the carcass rose clamouring
in the air and flew away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember?&#8221; cried Berselius.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good God!&#8221; said Adams. &#8220;Do I remember!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the body of the great beast they had passed when
in pursuit of the herd.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>Yes, there was no doubt now that Berselius was guiding
them aright. He had followed the track they had
come by without deviating a hundred yards.</p>
<p>The great animal was lying just as they had left it, but
the work of the birds was evident; horribly so, and it
was not a sight to linger over.</p>
<p>They descended into the river bed, passed up the other
bank, and went on, Berselius leading and Adams walking
by his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; said Adams, &#8220;I was beginning to
think you were out of the track.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berselius smiled.</p>
<p>Adams, who was glancing at his face, thought that he
had never seen an expression like that on the man&#8217;s face
before. The smile of the lips that had marked and
marred his countenance through life, the smile that was
half a sneer, was not there; this came about the eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was in exactly the same position, too,&#8221; said Adams.
&#8220;But the birds will have him down before long. Well,
he has served one purpose in his life; he has shown us
we are on the right road, and he has given you back
another bit of memory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor brute,&#8221; said Berselius.</p>
<p>These words, coming from the once iron-hearted
Berselius, struck Adams strangely; there was a trace of
pity in their tone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>THE FADING MIST</h3>
</div>

<p>They camped two hours before sundown. One of
the few mercies of this country is the number of
dead trees and the bushes from which one can
always scrape the materials for a fire.</p>
<p>Adams, with his hunting knife and a small hatchet
which was all steel and so had been uninjured in the
catastrophe, cut wood enough for the fire. They had
nothing to cook with, but fortunately the food they had
with them did not require cooking.</p>
<p>The tent was practicable, for the pole, so well had
it been spliced, was as good as new. They set it up,
and having eaten their supper, crept under it, leaving the
porters to keep watch or not as they chose.</p>
<p>Berselius, who had marched so well all day, had broken
down at the finish. He seemed half dead with weariness,
and scarcely spoke a word, eating mechanically and
falling to sleep immediately on lying down.</p>
<p>But he was happy. Happy as the man who suddenly
finds that he can outwalk the paralysis threatening him,
or the man who finds the fog of blindness lifting before
him, showing him again bit by bit the world he had
deemed forever lost. Whilst this man sleeps in the tent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
beside his companion and the waning moon breaks up
over the horizon and mixes her light with the red flicker
of the fire, a word about that past of which he was in
search may not be out of place.</p>
<p>Berselius was of mixed nationality. His father of
Swedish descent, his mother of French.</p>
<p>Armand Berselius the elder was what is termed a lucky
man. In other words, he had that keenness of intellect
which enables the possessor to seize opportunities and to
foresee events.</p>
<p>This art of looking into the future is the key to Aladdin&#8217;s
Palace and to the Temple of Power. To know what will
appreciate in value and what will depreciate, that is the
art of success in life, and that was the art which made
Armand Berselius a millionaire.</p>
<p>Berselius the younger grew up in an atmosphere of
money. His mother died when he was quite young. He
had neither brothers nor sisters; his father, a chilly-hearted
sensualist, had a dislike to the boy; for some obscure
reason, without any foundation in fact, he fancied that he
was some other man&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>The basis of an evil mind is distrust. Beware of
the man who is always fearful of being swindled. Who
cannot trust, cannot be trusted.</p>
<p>Berselius treated his son like a brute, and the boy,
with great power for love in his heart, conceived a hatred
for the man who misused him that was hellish in intensity.</p>
<p>But not a sign of it did he show. That power of will
and restraint so remarkable in the grown-up man was
not less remarkable in the boy. He bound his hate with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
iron bands and prisoned it, and he did this from pride.
When his father thrashed him for the slightest offence, he
showed not a sign of pain or passion; when the old man
committed that last outrage one can commit against the
mind of a child, and sneered at him before grown-up
people, young Berselius neither flushed nor moved an eyelid.
He handed the insult to the beast feeding at his
heart, and it devoured it and grew.</p>
<p>The spring was poisoned at its source.</p>
<p>That education of the heart which only love can give
was utterly cut off from the boy and supplanted by the
education of hate.</p>
<p>And the mind tainted thus from the beginning was an
extraordinary mind, a spacious intellect, great for evil
or great for good, never little, and fed by an unfailing
flood of energy.</p>
<p>The elder Berselius, as if bent on the utter damnation
of his son, kept him well supplied with money. He did
this from pride.</p>
<p>The young man took his graduate degree in vice, with
higher marks from the devil than any other young man
of his time. He passed through the college of St. Cyr
and into the cavalry, leaving it at the death of his father
and when he had obtained his captaincy.</p>
<p>He now found himself free, without a profession and
with forty million francs to squander, or save, or do what
he liked with.</p>
<p>He at once took his place as a man of affairs with one
hand in politics and the other in finance. There are a
dozen men like Berselius on the Continent of Europe.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
Politicians and financiers under the guise of Boulevardiers.
Men of leisure apparently, but, in reality, men of intellect,
who work their political and financial works quite unobtrusively
and yet have a considerable hand in the making
of events.</p>
<p>Berselius was one of these, varying the monotony of
social life with periodic returns to the wilderness.</p>
<p>With the foundation of the Congo State by King
Leopold, Berselius saw huge chances of profit. He
knew the country, for he had hunted there. He knew
the ivory, the copal, and the palm oil resources of the
place, and in the rubber vines he guessed an untapped
source of boundless wealth. He saw the great difficulty
in the way of making this territory a paying concern; that
is to say, he saw the labour question. Europeans would
not do the work; the blacks would not, unless paid, and
even then inefficiently.</p>
<p>To keep up a large force of European police to make
the blacks work on European terms, was out of the
question. The expense would run away with half the
profits; the troops would die, and, worst of all, other
nations would say, &#8220;What are you doing with that huge
army of men?&#8221; The word &#8220;slavery&#8221; had to be
eliminated from the proceedings, else the conscience of
Europe would be touched. He foresaw this, and he was
lost in admiration at the native police idea. The stroke
of genius that collected all the Félixes of the Congo basin
into an army of darkness, and collected all the weak and
defenceless into a herd of slaves, was a stroke after his
own heart.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></p>
<p>Of the greatest murder syndicate the world has ever
seen, Berselius became a member. He was not invited
to the bloody banquet&mdash;he invited himself.</p>
<p>He had struck the Congo in a hunting expedition;
he had seen and observed; later on, during a second
expedition, he had seen the germination of Leopold&#8217;s idea.
He dropped his gun and came back to Europe.</p>
<p>He was quite big enough to have smashed the whole
infernal machinery then and there. America had not
yet, hoodwinked, signed the licence to kill, which she
handed to Leopold on the 22d of April, 1884. Germany
had not been roped in. England and France were
still aloof, and Berselius, arriving at the psychological
moment, did not mince matters.</p>
<p>The result was two million pounds to his credit during
the next ten years.</p>
<p>So much for Berselius and his past.</p>
<p>An hour after dawn next day they started. The
morning was windless, warm, and silent, and the sun
shining broad on the land cast their shadows before
them as they went, the porters with their loads piled
on their heads, Adams carrying the tent-pole and tent,
Berselius leading.</p>
<p>He had recovered from his weakness of the night before.
He had almost recovered his strength, and he felt that
newness of being which the convalescent feels&mdash;that
feeling of new birth into the old world which pays one,
almost, for the pains of the past sickness.</p>
<p>Never since his boyhood had Berselius felt that keen
pleasure in the sun and the blue sky and the grass under
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
his feet; but it called up no memories of boyhood, for the
mist was still there, hiding boyhood and manhood and
<i>everything</i> up to the skyline.</p>
<p>But the mist did not frighten him now. He had
found a means of dispelling it; the photographic plates
were all there unbroken, waiting only to be collected and
put together, and he felt instinctively that after a time,
when he had collected a certain number, the brain would
gain strength, and all at once the mist would vanish for
ever, and he would be himself again.</p>
<p>Three hours after the start they passed a broken-down
tree.</p>
<p>Adams recognized it at once as the tree they had passed
on the hunt, shortly after turning from their path to follow
the herd of elephants.</p>
<p>Berselius was still leading them straight, and soon
they would come to the crucial point&mdash;the spot
where they had turned at right angles to follow the
elephants.</p>
<p>Would Berselius remember and turn, or would he
get confused and go on in a straight line?</p>
<p>The question was answered in another twenty minutes
by Berselius himself.</p>
<p>He stopped dead and waved his arm with a sweeping
motion to include all the country to the north.</p>
<p>&#8220;We came from there,&#8221; he said, indicating the north.
&#8220;We struck the elephant spoor just here, and turned due
west.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How on earth do you know?&#8221; asked Adams. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t see any indication, and for the life of me I couldn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
tell where we turned or whether we came from there,&#8221;
indicating the north, &#8220;or there,&#8221; pointing to the south.
&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do I know?&#8221; replied Berselius. &#8220;Why, this
place and everything we reach and pass is as vivid to
me as if I had passed it only two minutes ago. <i>It hits
me with such vividness that it blinds me.</i> It is that which
I believe makes the mist. The things I can see are so
extraordinarily vivid that they hide everything else. My
brain seems new born&mdash;every memory that comes back
to it comes back glorious in strength. If there were gods,
they would see as I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>A wind had arisen and it blew from the northwest.
Berselius inhaled it triumphantly.</p>
<p>Adams stood watching him. This piece-by-piece
return of memory, this rebuilding of the past foot by foot,
mile by mile, and horizon by horizon, was certainly the
strangest phenomenon of the brain that he had ever
come across.</p>
<p>This thing occurs in civilized life, but then it is far
less striking, for the past comes to a man from a hundred
close points&mdash;a thousand familiar things in his house or
surroundings call to him when he is brought back to them;
but here in the great, lone elephant land, the only familiar
thing was the track they had followed and the country
around it. If Berselius had been taken off that track and
placed a few miles away, he would have been as lost as
Adams.</p>
<p>They wheeled to the north, following in their leader&#8217;s
footsteps.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></p>
<p>That afternoon, late, they camped by the same pool
near which Berselius had shot the rhinos.</p>
<p>Adams, to make sure, walked away to where the great
bull had fought the cow before being laid low by the rifle
of the hunter.</p>
<p>The bones were there, picked clean and bleached,
exemplifying the eternal hunger of the desert, which is
one of the most horrible facts in life. These two great
brutes had been left nearly whole a few days ago; tons
of flesh had vanished like snow in sunshine, mist in
morning.</p>
<p>But Adams, as he gazed at the colossal bones, was
not thinking of that; the marvel of their return filled his
mind as he looked from the skeletons to where, against
the evening blue, a thin wreath of smoke rose up from
the camp fire which the porters had lighted.</p>
<p>Far away south, so far away as to be scarcely discernible,
a bird was sailing along, sliding on the wind without a
motion of the wings. It passed from sight and left the
sky stainless, and the land lay around silent with the tremendous
silence of evening, and lifeless as the bones
bleaching at his feet.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>I AM THE FOREST</h3>
</div>

<p>The day after the next, two hours before noon,
they passed an object which Adams remembered
well.</p>
<p>It was the big tree which Berselius had pointed out
to him as having been tusked by an elephant; and an
hour after they had started from the mid-day rest, the
horizon to the north changed and grew dark.</p>
<p>It was the forest.</p>
<p>The sky immediately above the dark line, from contrast,
was extraordinarily bright and pale, and, as they
marched, the line lifted and the trees grew.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; said Berselius.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; replied Adams.</p>
<p>A question was troubling his mind. Would Berselius
be able to guide them amidst the trees? Here in the
open he had a hundred tiny indications on either side
of him, but amidst the trees how could he find his way?
Was it possible that memory could lead him through that
labyrinth once it grew dense?</p>
<p>It will be remembered that it was a two days&#8217; march
from Fort M&#8217;Bassa through the isthmus of woods to
the elephant country. At the edge of the forest the trees
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
were very thinly set, but for the rest, and a day&#8217;s march
from the fort, it was jungle.</p>
<p>Would Berselius be able to penetrate that jungle?
Time would tell. Berselius knew nothing about it; he
only knew what lay before his sight.</p>
<p>Toward evening the trees came out to meet them,
baobab and monkey-bread, set widely apart; and they
camped by a pool and lit their fire, and slept as men sleep
in the pure air of the woods and the desert.</p>
<p>Next morning they pursued their journey, Berselius
still confident. At noon, however, he began to exhibit
slight signs of agitation and anxiety. The trees were
thickening around them; he still knew the way, but the
view before him was getting shorter and shorter as the
trees thickened; that is to say, the mist was coming closer
and closer. He knew nothing of the dense jungle before
them; he only knew that the clear road in front of him
was shortening up rapidly and horribly, and that if it
continued to do so it would inevitably vanish.</p>
<p>The joy that had filled his heart became transformed
to the grief which the man condemned to blindness feels
when he sees the bright world fading from his sight,
slowly but surely as the expiring flame of a lamp.</p>
<p>He walked more rapidly, and the more rapidly he went
the shorter did the road before him grow.</p>
<p>All at once the forest&mdash;which had been playing, up to
this, with Berselius as a cat plays with a mouse&mdash;all at
once the forest, like a great green Sphinx, put down its
great green paw and spoke from its cavernous heart&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am the Forest.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>They had passed almost at a step into the labyrinths.
Plantain leaves hit them insolently in the face, lianas
hung across their path like green ropes placed to bar
them out, weeds tangled the foot.</p>
<p>Berselius, like an animal that finds itself trapped,
plunged madly forward. Adams following closely behind
heard him catching back his breath with a sob.
They plunged on for a few yards, and then Berselius
stood still.</p>
<p>The forest was very silent, and seemed listening. The
evening light and the shade of the leaves cast gloom around
them. Adams could hear his own heart thumping and
the breathing of the porters behind him. If Berselius
had lost his way, then they were lost indeed.</p>
<p>After a moment Berselius spoke, as a man speaks whose
every hope in life is shattered.</p>
<p>&#8220;The path is gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adams&#8217;s only reply was a deep intake of the breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing before me. I am lost.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we try back?&#8221; said Adams, speaking in that
hard tone which comes when a man is commanding his
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back? Of what use? I cannot go back; I must
go forward. But here there is nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The unhappy man&#8217;s voice was terrible to hear. He
had marched so triumphantly all day, drawing nearer
at each step to himself, to that self which memory had
hidden from him and which memory was disclosing bit
by bit. And now the march was interrupted as if by
a wall set across his path.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></p>
<p>But Adams was of a type of man to whom despondency
may be known, but never despair.</p>
<p>They had marched all day; they were lost, it is true, but
they were not far, now, from Fort M&#8217;Bassa. The immediate
necessity was rest and food.</p>
<p>There was a little clearing amidst the trees just here,
and with his own hands he raised the tent. They had no
fire, but the moon when she rose, though in her last quarter,
lit up the forest around them with a green glow-worm
glimmer. One could see the lianas and the trees, the
broad leaves shining with dew, some bright, some sketched
in dimly, and all bathed in gauze green light; and they
could hear the drip and patter of dew on leaf and branch.</p>
<p>This is a mournful sound&mdash;the most mournful of all
the sounds that fill the great forests of the Congo. It
is so casual, so tearful. One might fancy it the sound
of the forest weeping to itself in the silence of the night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>GOD SENDS A GUIDE</h3>
</div>

<p>To be lost in the desert or in a land like the elephant
country is bad, but to be lost in the dense parts
of the tropical forest is far worse.</p>
<p>You are in a horrible labyrinth, a maze, not of intricate
paths but of blinding curtains. I am speaking now of that
arrogant jungle, moist and hot, where life is in full ferment,
and where the rubber vine grows and thrives; where you
go knee-deep in slush and catch at a tree-bole to prevent
yourself going farther, cling, sweating at every pore
and shivering like a dog, feeling for firmer ground and
finding it, only to be led on to another quagmire. The
bush pig avoids this place, the leopard shuns it; it is
bad in the dry season when the sun gives some light
by day, and the moon a gauzy green glimmer by night,
but in the rains it is terrific. Night, then, is black as
the inside of a trunk, and day is so feeble that your hand,
held before your face at arm&#8217;s length, is just a shadow.
The westward part of the forest of M&#8217;Bonga projects a
spur of the pestiferous rubber-bearing land into the
isthmus of healthy woods. It was just at the tip of
this spur that Berselius and his party were entangled
and lost.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></p>
<p>The two porters were Yandjali men, they knew nothing
of these woods, and were utterly useless as guides;
they sat now amidst the leaves near the tent eating their
food; dark shadows in the glow-worm light, the glistening
black skin of a knee or shoulder showing up touched
by the glimmer in which leaf and liana, tree trunk and
branch, seemed like marine foliage bathed in the watery
light of a sea-cave.</p>
<p>Adams had lit a pipe, and he sat beside Berselius at
the opening of the tent, smoking. The glare of the match
had shown him the face of Berselius for a moment.
Berselius, since his first outcry on finding the path gone,
had said little, and there was a patient and lost look on
his face, sad but most curious to see. Most curious,
for it said fully what a hundred little things had been
hinting since their start from the scene of the catastrophe&mdash;that
the old Berselius had vanished and a new
Berselius had taken his place. Adams had at first put
down the change in his companion to weakness, but the
weakness had passed, the man&#8217;s great vitality had
reasserted itself, and the change was still there.</p>
<p>This was not the man who had engaged him in Paris;
this person might have been a mild twin-brother of the
redoubtable Captain of the Avenue Malakoff, of Matadi
and Yandjali. When memory came fully back, would it
bring with it the old Berselius, or would the new Berselius,
mild, inoffensive, and kindly, suddenly find himself
burdened with the tremendous past of the man he once
had been?</p>
<p>Nothing is more true than that the human mind from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
accident, from grief, or from that mysterious excitement,
during which in half an hour a blaspheming
costermonger &#8220;gets religion&#8221; and becomes a saint of
God&mdash;nothing is more certain than that the human
mind can like this, at a flash, turn topsy-turvy; the good
coming to the top, the bad going to the bottom. Mechanical
pressure on the cortex of the brain can bring this
state of things about, even as it can convert a saint of God
into a devil incarnate.</p>
<p>Was Berselius under the influence of forced amendment
of this sort?</p>
<p>Adams was not even considering the matter, he was
lost in gloomy thoughts.</p>
<p>He was smoking slowly, holding his index and middle
fingers over the pipe-bowl to prevent the tobacco burning
too quickly, for he had only a couple of pipefuls
left. He was thinking that to-morrow evening the pouch
would be empty, when, from somewhere in the forest
near by, there came a sound which brought him to his
feet and the two porters up on hands and knees like
listening dogs.</p>
<p>It was the sound of a human voice raised in a sort
of chant, ghostly and mournful as the sound of the falling
dew. As it came, rising and falling, monotonous and
rhythmical, the very plain song of desolation, Adams
felt his hair lift and his flesh crawl, till one of the porters,
springing erect from his crouching position, sent his
voice through the trees&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahi ahee!&#8221;</p>
<p>The song ceased; and then, a moment later, faint
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
and wavering, and like the voice of a seagull, came
the reply&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahi aheee!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Man,&#8221; said the porter, turning white eyeballs and
glinting teeth over his shoulder at Adams.</p>
<p>He called again, and again came the reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick,&#8221; said Adams, seizing the arm of Berselius,
who had risen, &#8220;there&#8217;s a native here somewhere about;
he may guide us out of this infernal place; follow me, and
for God&#8217;s sake keep close.&#8221;</p>
<p>Holding Berselius by the arm, and motioning the
other native to follow, he seized the porter by the shoulder
and pushed him forward. The man knew what was
required and obeyed, advancing, calling, and listening
by turns, till, at last, catching the true direction of the
sound he went rapidly, Berselius and Adams following
close behind. Sometimes they were half up to the knees
in boggy patches, fighting their way through leaves that
struck them like great wet hands; sometimes the call in
the distance seemed farther away, and they held their
pace, they held their breath, they clung to each other,
listening, till, now, by some trick of the trees, though
they had not moved and though there was no wind, the
cry came nearer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahi, ahee!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, at last, a dim red glow shone through the foliage
before them and bursting their way through the leaves
they broke into an open space where, alone, by a small
fire of dry branches and brushwood, sat a native, stark
naked, except for a scrap of dingy loincloth, and looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
like a black gnome, a faun of this horrible place, and
the very concretion of its desolation and death.</p>
<p>He was sitting when they caught their first glimpse
of him, with his chin supported on his hand, but the
instant he saw the faces of the white men he rose
as if to escape, then the porter called out something
that reassured him, and he sat down again
and shivered.</p>
<p>He was one of the rubber collectors. He had reached
this spot the day before, and had built himself a shelter
of leaves and branches. He would be here for ten days
or a fortnight, and his food, chiefly cassava, lay in a little
pile in the shelter, covered over with leaves.</p>
<p>The porter continued speaking to the collector, who,
now regaining the use of his limbs, stood up before the
white men, hands folded in front of him, and his eyes
rolling from Berselius to Adams.</p>
<p>&#8220;M&#8217;Bassa,&#8221; said Adams, touching the porter, pointing
to the collector, and then away into the forest in the
direction he fancied Fort M&#8217;Bassa to be.</p>
<p>The porter understood. He said a few words to the
collector, who nodded his head furiously and struck
himself on the breast with his open hand.</p>
<p>Then the porter turned again to Adams.</p>
<p>&#8220;M&#8217;Bassa,&#8221; said he, nodding his head, pointing to the
collector, and then away into the forest.</p>
<p>That was all, but it meant that they were saved.</p>
<p>Adams gave a great whoop that echoed away through
the trees, startling bats and birds in the branches and
losing itself without an echo in the depths of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
gloom. Then he struck himself a blow on the chest
with his fist.</p>
<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; said he, &#8220;the tent!&#8221;</p>
<p>They had only travelled an eighth of a mile or so from
the camping place, but they had wandered this way and
that before the porter had found the true direction of the
call, and the tent, provisions, and everything else were
lost as utterly and irrevocably as though they had been
dropped in mid-ocean.</p>
<p>To step aside from a thing&mdash;even for a hundred
yards&mdash;in this terrible place was to lose it; even the
rubber collectors, from whom the forest holds few
secrets have, in these thick places, to blaze a trail by
breaking branches, tying lianas and marking tree
trunks.</p>
<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; said Berselius in a weary voice, &#8220;we have
lost even that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter,&#8221; said Adams, &#8220;we have got a guide.
Cheer up, this man will take us to Fort M&#8217;Bassa and
there you will find the road again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; said Berselius, a touch of hope
in his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure? Certain. You&#8217;ve forgotten Fort M&#8217;Bassa.
Well, when you see it, you will remember it, and it will
lead you right away home. Cheer up, cheer up; we&#8217;ve
got a fire and a bit of shelter for you to sleep under, and
we&#8217;ll start bright and early in the morning, and this
black imp of Satan will lead you straight back to your road
and your memory&mdash;hey! Uncle Joe!&#8221;</p>
<p>He patted the collector on the naked shoulder and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
a faint grin appeared on that individual&#8217;s forlorn countenance;
never had he come across a white man like this
before. Then, bustling about, Adams piled up the fire
with more sticks, got Berselius under the shelter of the
collector&#8217;s wretched hut, sat himself down close to the fire,
produced his pipe, and proceeded, in one glorious debauch,
to finish the last of his tobacco.</p>
<p>This rubber collector, the last and the humblest
creature on earth, had given them fire and shelter; they
were also to be beholden to him for food. His wretched
cassava cakes and his calabash of water gave them their
breakfast next morning, and then they started, the collector
leading, walking before them through the dense
growth of the trees as assuredly as a man following a
well-known road. It was a terrible thing for him to
leave his post, but the white men were from M&#8217;Bassa and
wished to return to M&#8217;Bassa, and M&#8217;Bassa was the head
centre of his work and the terrible Mecca of his fears.
White men from there and going to there must be obeyed.</p>
<p>This was the last phase of the great hunt. Berselius
had been slowly stripped by the wilderness of everything
now but the clothes he stood up in, his companion
and two porters. Guns, equipment, tents, stores, the
Zappo Zap, and the army of men under that ferocious
lieutenant, had all &#8220;gone dam.&#8221; He was mud to the
knees, his clothing was torn, he was mud to the elbows
from having tripped last night and fallen in a quagmire,
his face was white and drawn and grimy as the face of a
London cabrunner, his hair was grayer and dull, but his
eyes were bright and he was happy. At M&#8217;Bassa he would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
be put upon the road again&mdash;the only road to the thing he
craved for as burning Dives craved for water&mdash;himself.</p>
<p>But it was ordained that he should find that questionably
desirous person before reaching M&#8217;Bassa.</p>
<p>They had been on the march for an hour when Adams,
fussing like a person who is making his first journey by
rail, stopped the guide to make sure he was leading them
right.</p>
<p>&#8220;M&#8217;Bassa?&#8221; said Adams.</p>
<p>&#8220;M&#8217;Bassa,&#8221; replied the other, nodding his head.
Then with outspread hand he pointed before them and
made a semicircular sweep to indicate that he was leading
them for some reason by a circuitous route.</p>
<p>He was making, in fact, for open ground that would
bring them in the direction of the fort by a longer but
much easier road than a direct line through the jungle.
He was making also for water, for his scant supply had
been exhausted by his guests, and he knew the road he
was taking would lead him to broad pools of water.
Adams nodded his head to imply that he understood,
and the man led on.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>THE VISION OF THE POOLS</h3>
</div>

<p>Somewhere about noon they halted for a rest
and some food. It was less boggy here, and
the sunlight showed stronger through the dense
roof of foliage. The cassava cakes were tainted with
must, and they had no water, but the increasing light
made them forget everything but the freedom that was
opening before them.</p>
<p>Adams pointed to the empty calabash which their
guide carried, and the collector nodded and pointed before
them, as if to imply that soon they would come to water
and that all would be well.</p>
<p>Now, as they resumed their way, the trees altered
and drew farther apart, the ground was solid under
foot, and through the foliage of the euphorbia and
raphia palm came stray glimmers of sunshine, bits of
blue sky, birds, voices, and the whisper of a breeze.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is better,&#8221; said Berselius.</p>
<p>Adams flung up his head and expanded his nostrils.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better, my God!&#8221; said he; &#8220;this is heaven!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was heaven, indeed, after that hell of gloom; that
bog roofed in with leaves, the very smell of which clings
to one for ever like the memory of a fever dream.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>All at once patches of sunlight appeared in front as
well as above. They quickened their pace, the trees
drew apart, and, suddenly, with theatrical effect, a park-like
sward of land lay before them leading to a sheet
of blue water reflecting tall feather-palms and waving
speargrass, all domed over with blue, and burning in
the bright, bright sunshine.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Silent Pools!&#8221; cried Adams. &#8220;The very place
where I saw the leopard chasing the antelope! Great
Scott!&mdash;Hi! hi! hi! you there!&mdash;where are you going?&#8221;</p>
<p>The collector had raced down to the water&#8217;s edge;
he knew the dangers of the place, for he divided the
grass, filled his calabash with water, and dashed back
before anything could seize him. Then, without drinking,
he came running with the calabash to the white
men.</p>
<p>Adams handed the calabash first to his companion.</p>
<p>Berselius drank and then wiped his forehead; he
seemed disturbed in his mind and had a dazed look.</p>
<p>He had never come so far along the edge of the pools
as this, but there was something in the configuration
of the place that stirred his sleeping memory.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Adams.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Berselius. &#8220;I have dreamt&mdash;I
have seen&mdash;I remember something&mdash;somewhere&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Adams laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said he; &#8220;you come along, and in a few
minutes you will see something that will help your memory.
Why, man, we camped near here, you and I and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
Meeus; when you see the spot you&#8217;ll find yourself on your
road again. Come, let&#8217;s make a start.&#8221;</p>
<p>The collector was standing with the half-full calabash
in his hands.</p>
<p>He had not dared to drink. Adams nodded to him,
motioning him to do so, but he handed it first to the porter.
Then, when the porter had drunk, the collector finished
the remains of the water and the last few drops he flung
on the ground, an offering, perhaps, to some god or devil
of his own. Then he led on, skirting the water&#8217;s edge.
The loveliness of the place had not lessened since Adams
had seen it last; even the breeze that was blowing to-day
did not disturb the spirit of sweet and profound peace
which held in a charm this lost garden of the wilderness;
the palms bent as if in sleep, the water dimpled to the
breeze and seemed to smile, a flamingo, with rose-coloured
wings, passed and flew before them and vanished beyond
the rocking tops of the trees that still sheltered the camping
place where once Berselius had raised his tent.</p>
<p>Again, with theatrical effect, as the pools had burst
upon them on leaving the forest, the camping place
unveiled itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Adams in triumph, &#8220;do you remember
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Berselius did not reply. He was walking along with
his eyes fixed straight before him. He did not stop,
or hesitate, or make any exclamation to indicate whether
he remembered or not.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember?&#8221; cried Adams.</p>
<p>But Berselius did not speak. He was making noises
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
as if strangling, and suddenly his hands flew up to the
neck of his hunting shirt, and tore at it till he tore it open.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steady, man, steady,&#8221; cried Adams catching the
other&#8217;s arm. &#8220;Hi, you&#8217;ll be in a fit if you don&#8217;t mind&mdash;steady,
I <i>say</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Berselius heard nothing, knew nothing but the
scene before him, and Adams, who was running now
after the afflicted man, who had broken away and was
making straight for the trees beneath which the village
had once been, heard and knew nothing of what lay before
and around Berselius.</p>
<p>Berselius had stepped out of the forest an innocent
man, and behold! memory had suddenly fronted him
with a hell in which he was the chief demon.</p>
<p>He had no time to accommodate himself to the situation,
no time for sophistry. He was not equipped with
the forty years of steadily growing callousness that had
vanished; the fiend who had inspired him with the lust
for torture had deserted him, and the sight and the knowledge
of himself came as suddenly as a blow in the face.</p>
<p>Under that m&#8217;bina tree two soldiers, one with the
haft of a blood-stained knife between his teeth, had
mutilated horribly a living girl. Little Papeete had
been decapitated just where his skull lay now; the shrieks
and wails of the tortured tore the sky above Berselius;
but Adams heard nothing and saw nothing but Berselius
raving amidst the remains.</p>
<p>Bones lay here and bones lay there, clean picked by
the vultures and white bleached by the sun; skulls, jawbones,
femurs, broken or whole. The remains of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
miserable huts faced the strewn and miserable bones,
and the trees blew their golden trumpets over all.</p>
<p>As Adams looked from the man who with shrill cries
was running about as a frantic woman runs about, to
the bones on the ground, he guessed the tragedy of
Berselius. But he was to hear it in words spoken with the
torrid eloquence of madness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>THE AVENGER</h3>
</div>

<p>It was a hot night up at the fort, a night eloquent
of the coming rains. The door of the guest house
stood open and the light of the paraffin lamp lay
upon the veranda and the ground of the yard, forming
a parallelogram of topaz across which were flitting continually
great moth shadows big as birds.</p>
<p>Andreas Meeus was seated at the white-wood table
of the sitting room before a big blue sheet of paper.
He held a pen in his hand, but he was not writing just
at present; he was reading what he had written.</p>
<p>He was, in fact, making up his three-monthly report
for headquarters, and he found it difficult, because the
last three months had brought in little rubber and less
ivory. A lot of things had conspired to make trade bad.
Sickness had swept two villages entirely away; one village,
as we know, had revolted; then, vines had died
from some mysterious disease in two of the very best
patches of the forest. All these explanations Meeus was
now putting on paper for the edification of the Congo
Government. He was devoting a special paragraph to
the revolt of the village by the Silent Pools, and the
punishment he had dealt out to the natives. Not a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
word was said of torture and slaughtering. &#8220;Drastic
Measures&#8221; was the term he used, a term perfectly well
understood by the people to whom he was writing.</p>
<p>On the wall behind him the leopard-skin still hung,
looking now shrivelled at the edges in this extreme heat.
On the wall in front of him the Congo bows and poisoned
arrows looked more venomous and deadly than by the
light of day. A scorpion twice the size of a penny was
making a circuit of the walls just below the ceiling;
you could hear a faint scratch from it as it travelled along,
a scratch that seemed an echo of Meeus&#8217;s pen as it
travelled across the paper.</p>
<p>He held between his lips the everlasting cigarette.</p>
<p>Sitting thus, meditating, pen in hand, he heard sounds:
the sound of the night wind, the sound of one of the
soldiers singing as he cleaned his rifle&mdash;the men always
sang over this business, as if to propitiate the gun god&mdash;the
scratch of the scorpion and the &#8220;creak, creak&#8221; of a
joist warping and twisting to the heat.</p>
<p>But the sound of the wind was the most arresting.
It would come over the forest and up the slope and
round the guest house with a long-drawn, sweeping
&#8220;Ha-a-a-r,&#8221; and sob once or twice, and then die away
down the slope and over the forest and away and beyond
to the east, where Kilimanjaro was waiting for it, crowned
with snow on his throne beneath the stars.</p>
<p>But the wind was almost dead now&mdash;the heat of
the night had stifled it. The faintest breathing of
air took the place of the strong puffs that had sent
the flame of the lamp half up the glass chimney. As
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
Meeus listened, on this faint breath from the forest
he heard a sound&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Boom&mdash;boom&#8221;&mdash;very faint, and as if someone were
striking a drum in a leisurely manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boom&mdash;boom.&#8221;</p>
<p>A great man-ape haunted this part of the forest of
M&#8217;Bonga like an evil spirit. He had wandered here,
perhaps from the west coast forests. Driven away from
his species&mdash;who knows?&mdash;for some crime. The natives
of the fort had caught glimpses of him now and then; he
was huge and old and gray, and now in the darkness
of the forest was striking himself on the chest, standing
there in the gloom of the leaves, trampling the plantains
under foot, taller than the tallest man, smiting himself
in the pride of his strength.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boom&mdash;boom.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is a hair-lifting sound when you know the cause,
but it left Meeus unmoved. His mind was too full of
the business of writing his report to draw images
or listen to imagination; all the same, this sinister
drum-beat acted upon his subconscious self and, scarcely
knowing why he did so, he got up from the table and
came outside to the fort wall and looked over away
into the dark.</p>
<p>There was not a star in the sky. A dense pall of
cloud stretched from horizon to horizon, and the wind, as
Meeus stepped from the veranda into the darkness,
died away utterly.</p>
<p>He stood looking into the dark. He could make out
the forest, a blackness humped and crouching in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
surrounding blackness. There was not a ray of light
from the sky, and now and again came the drum&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Boom&mdash;boom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then it ceased, and a bat passed so close that the
wind of it stirred his hair. He spat the taint of it from
his mouth, and returning to the house, seated himself at
the table and continued his work.</p>
<p>But the night was to be fateful in sounds and surprises.
He had not been sitting five minutes when a
voice from the blackness outside made him drop his pen
and listen.</p>
<p>It was a European voice, shouting and raving and
laughing, and Meeus, as he listened, clutched at the table,
for the voice was known to him. It was the voice of
Berselius!</p>
<p>Berselius, who was hundreds of miles away in the
elephant country!</p>
<p>Meeus heard his own name. It came in to him out
of the darkness, followed by a peal of laughter. Rapid
steps sounded coming across the courtyard, and the sweat
ran from Meeus&#8217;s face and his stomach crawled as, with
a bound across the veranda, a huge man framed himself
in the doorway and stood motionless as a statue.</p>
<p>For the first moment Meeus did not recognize Adams.
He was filthy and tattered, he wore no coat, and his
hunting shirt was open at the neck, and the arms of it
rolled up above the elbows.</p>
<p>Adams, for the space of ten seconds, stood staring
at Meeus from under his pith helmet. The face under
the helmet seemed cast from bronze.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<p>Then he came in and shut the door behind him, walked
to the table, took Meeus by the coat at the back of the
neck, and lifted him up as a man lifts a dog by the scruff.</p>
<p>For a moment it seemed as if he were going to kill the
wretched man without word or explanation, but he mastered
himself with a supreme effort, put him down, took
the vacant seat at the table and cried:</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand before me there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meeus stood. He held on to the table with his left hand
and with his right he made pawing movements in the air.</p>
<p>The big man seated at the table did not notice. He
sat for a few seconds with both hands clasped together,
one making a cup for the other, just as a man might
sit about to make a speech and carefully considering
his opening words.</p>
<p>Then he spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Did you kill those people by the Silent Pools?</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Meeus made no reply, but drew a step back and put
out his hand, as if fending the question off, as if asking
for a moment in which to explain. He had so many
things to say, so many reasons to give, but he could say
nothing, for his tongue was paralyzed and his lips were dry.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Did you kill those people by the Silent Pools?</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>The awful man at the table was beginning to work
himself up. He had risen at the second question, and
at the third time of asking he seized Meeus by the shoulders.
&#8220;<i>Did you kill those people&mdash;&mdash;?</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Punishment,&#8221; stuttered Meeus.</p>
<p>A cry like the cry of a woman and a crash that shook
the plaster from the ceiling, followed the fatal word.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
Adams had swung the man aloft and dashed him against
the wall with such force, that the wattling gave and the
plaster fell in flakes.</p>
<p>Meeus lay still as death, staring at his executioner with
a face expressionless and white as the plaster flakes
around him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get up,&#8221; said Adams.</p>
<p>Meeus heard and moved his arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the arms moved and the body raised itself,
but the legs did not move. &#8220;I cannot,&#8221; said Meeus.</p>
<p>Adams came to him and bending down pinched his
right thigh hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you feel me touching you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adams did the same to the other thigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you feel that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lie there,&#8221; said Adams.</p>
<p>He opened the door and went out into the night. A
moment later he returned; after him came the two porters
bearing Berselius between them.</p>
<p>Berselius was quiet now; the brain fever that had
stricken him had passed into a muttering stage, and he
let himself be carried, passive as a bag of meal, whilst
Adams went before with the lamp leading the way into
the bedroom. Here, on one of the beds, the porters laid
their burden down. Then they came back, and under
the directions of Adams lifted Meeus and carried him
into the bedroom and placed him on the second bed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></p>
<p>Adams, with the lamp in his hand, stood for a moment
looking at Meeus. His rage had spent itself; he had
avenged the people at the Silent Pools. With his naked
hands he had inflicted on the criminal before him an
injury worse than the injury of fire or sword.</p>
<p>Meeus, frightened now by the pity in the face of the
other, horribly frightened by the unknown thing that
had happened to him, making him dead from the waist
down, moved his lips, but made no sound.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your back is broken,&#8221; replied Adams to the question
in the other&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>Then he turned to Berselius.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>At midnight the rains broke with a crash of thunder
that seemed to shake the universe.</p>
<p>Adams, worn out, was seated at the table in the living
room smoking some tobacco he had found in a tin on
the shelf, and listening to the rambling of Berselius,
when the thunder-clap came, making the lamp shiver on
the table.</p>
<p>Meeus, who had been silent since his death sentence
had been read to him, cried out at the thunder, but Berselius
did not heed&mdash;he was hunting elephants under
a burning sun in a country even vaster than the elephant
country.</p>
<p>Adams rose up and came to the door; not a drop of
rain had fallen yet. He crossed the yard and stood
at the fort wall looking into blackness. It was solid
as ebony, and he could hear the soldiers, whose huts were
outside the wall, calling to one another.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></p>
<p>A great splash of light lit up the whole roof of the forest
clear as day, and the darkness shut down again with a
bang that hit the ear like a blow, and the echoes of it
roared and rumbled and muttered, and died, and Silence
wrapped herself again in her robe and sat to wait.</p>
<p>Now, there was a faint stirring of the air, increasing
to a breeze, and far away a sound like the spinning of
a top came on the breeze. It was the rain, miles away,
coming over the forest in a solid sheet, the sound of it
increasing on the great drum of the forest&#8217;s roof to a roar.</p>
<p>Another flash lit the world, and Adams saw the rain.</p>
<p>He saw what it is given to very few men to see. From
horizon to horizon, as if built by plumb, line and square,
stretched a glittering wall, reaching from the forest to
the sky. The base of this wall was lost in snow-white
billows of spray and mist.</p>
<p>Never was there so tremendous a sight as this infinite
wall and the Niagara clouds of spray, roaring, living,
and lit by the great flash one second, drowned out by the
darkness and the thunder the next.</p>
<p>Adams, terrified, ran back to the house, shut the door,
and waited.</p>
<p>The house was solidly built and had withstood many
rains, but there were times when it seemed to him that
the whole place must be washed away bodily. Nothing
could be heard but the rain, and the sound of such
rain is far more terrifying than the sound of thunder or
the rumble of the earthquake.</p>
<p>There were times when he said to himself, &#8220;This cannot
last,&#8221; yet it lasted. With the lamp in his hand he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
went into the sleeping room to see how Berselius and
Meeus were doing. Berselius was still, to judge from
the movements of his lips, delirious, and just the same.
Meeus was lying with his hands on his breast. He might
have been asleep, only for his eyes, wide open and bright,
and following every movement of the man with the lamp.</p>
<p>Meeus, catching the other&#8217;s eye, motioned to him to
come near. Then he tried to speak, but the roar outside
made it impossible to hear him. Adams pointed to the
roof, as if to say, &#8220;Wait till it is over,&#8221; then he came
back to the sitting room, tore the leopard skin down
from the wall, rolled it up for a pillow, and lay down with
his head on it.</p>
<p>He had been through so much of late that he had grown
callous and case-hardened; he did not care much whether
the place was washed away or not&mdash;he wanted to sleep,
and he slept.</p>
<p>Meeus, left alone, lay watching the glimmer of the
lamp shining through the cracks of the door, and listening
to the thunder of the rain.</p>
<p>This was the greatest rain he had experienced. He
wondered if it would flood the go-down and get at the rubber
stored there; he wondered if the soldiers had deserted
their huts and taken refuge in the office. These thoughts
were of not the slightest interest to him; they just came
and strayed across his mind, which was still half-paralyzed
by the great calamity that had befallen him.</p>
<p>For the last half-hour an iron hand seemed round his
body just on a level with the diaphragm; this seemed
growing tighter, and the tighter it grew the more difficult
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
it was to breathe. The fracture had been very high up,
but he knew nothing of this; he knew that his back was
broken, and that men with broken backs die, but he did
not fully realize that he was going to die till&mdash;all at once&mdash;his
breathing stopped dead of its own accord, and then of
its own accord went on rapidly and shallowly. Then he
recognized that his breathing was entirely under the
control of something over which <i>he</i> had no control.</p>
<p>This is the most terrible thing a man can know, for it
is a thing that no man ever knows till he is in the hands
of death.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>It was daylight when Adams awoke, and the rain
had ceased.</p>
<p>He went to the door and opened it. It was after
sunrise, but the sun was not to be seen. The whole
world was a vapour, but through which the forest was
dimly visible. The soldiers were in the courtyard; they
had just come out of the office where they had taken refuge
during the night. Their huts had been washed away, but
they did not seem to mind a bit; they showed their teeth
in a grin, and shouted something when they saw the white
man, and pointed to the rainswept yard and the sky.</p>
<p>Adams nodded, and then went back into the house
and into the bedroom, where he found Meeus hanging
head downward out of his bed.</p>
<p>Rubber would trouble Andreas Meeus no more;
his soul had gone to join the great army of souls in
the Beyond.</p>
<p>It is strange enough to look upon the body of a man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
you have killed. But Adams had no more pity or compunction
in his mind than if Meeus had been a stoat.</p>
<p>He turned to Berselius, who was sleeping. The delirium
had passed, and he was breathing evenly and well. There
was hope for him yet&mdash;hope for his body if not for his
mind.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<h3>THE VOICE OF THE FOREST BY NIGHT</h3>
</div>

<p>The first thing to be done was to bury Meeus.
And now came the question, How would the
soldiers take the death of the <i>Chef de Poste</i>?
They knew nothing of it yet. Would they revolt, or
would they seek to revenge him, guessing him to have
been killed.</p>
<p>Adams did not know and he did not care. He half
hoped there would be trouble. The Congo had burst
upon his view, stripped of shams, in all its ferocity, just as
the great scene of the killing had burst upon Berselius.
All sorts of things&mdash;from the Hostage House of Yandjali
to the Hostage House of M&#8217;Bassa, from Mass to
Papeete&#8217;s skull&mdash;connected themselves up and made
a skeleton, from which he constructed that great and
ferocious monster, the Congo State. The soldiers, with
their filed teeth, were part of the monster, and, such was
the depth of fury in his heart, he would have welcomed
a fight, so that he might express with his arms what
his tongue ached to say.</p>
<p>The original man loomed large in Adams. God had
given him a character benign and just, a heart tempered
to mercy and kindliness; all these qualities had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
outraged and were now under arms. They had given a
mandate to the original man to act. The death of Meeus
was the first result.</p>
<p>He went to the shelf where Meeus had kept his official
letters and took Meeus&#8217;s Mauser pistol from it. It was
in a holster attached to a belt. He strapped the belt
round his waist, drew the pistol from the holster and
examined it. It was loaded, and in an old cigar-box he
found a dozen clips of cartridges. He put three of these
in his pocket and with the pistol at his side came out into
the courtyard.</p>
<p>Huge billows of white cloud filled the sky, broken here
and there by a patch of watery blue. The whole earth
was steaming and the forest was absolutely smoking.
One could have sworn it was on fire in a dozen places when
the spirals of mist rose and broke and vanished like the
steam clouds from locomotive chimneys.</p>
<p>He crossed the courtyard to the go-down, undid the
locking bar and found what he wanted. Half a dozen
mattocks stood by the rubber bales&mdash;he had noticed
them when the stores had been taken out for the
expedition; they were still in the same place and, taking
two of them, he went to the break in the wall that gave
exit from the courtyard and called to the soldiers, who
were busy at work rebuilding their huts.</p>
<p>They came running. He could not speak twenty words
of their language, but he made them line up with a movement
of his arm.</p>
<p>Then he addressed them in a perfectly unprintable
speech. It was delivered in unshod American&mdash;a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
language he had not spoken for years. It took in each
individual of the whole gang, it told them they were dogs
and sons of dogs, killers of men, unmentionable carrion,
cayotes, kites, and that he would have hanged them each
and individually with his own hands (and I believe by
some legerdemain of strength he would), but that they
were without hearts, souls or intellect, not responsible
creatures, tools of villains that he, Adams, would expose
and get even with yet.</p>
<p>Furthermore, that if by a look or movement they disobeyed
his orders, he would make them sweat tears and
weep blood, so help him God. Amen.</p>
<p>They understood what he said. At least they understood
the gist of it. They had found a new and angry
master, and not an eye was raised when Adams stood
silent; some looked at their toes and some at the ground,
some looked this way, some that, but none at the big,
ferocious man, with three weeks&#8217; growth of beard, standing
before them and, literally, over them.</p>
<p>Then he chose two of them and motioned them to
follow to the guest house. There he brought them
into the sleeping room and pointed to the body of Meeus,
motioning them to take it up and carry it out. The men
rolled their eyes at the sight of the <i>Chef de Poste</i>, but they
said no word; one took the head, the other the feet, and
between them they carried the burden, led by their new
commander, through the dwelling room, across the
veranda and then across the yard.</p>
<p>The rest of the soldiers were in a group near the gate.
When they saw the two men and their burden, they set
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
up a chattering like a flock of magpies, which, however,
instantly ceased at the approach of Adams.</p>
<p>He pointed to the two mattocks which he had placed
against the wall. They understood what he meant; the
last <i>Chef de Poste</i> had shot himself in the presence of the
District Commissioner, and they had dug his grave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; said Adams, stopping and pointing to a spot
at a convenient distance from the walls.</p>
<p>When the body was buried, Adams stood for a second
looking at the mound of earth, wet and flattened down
by blows of the spades.</p>
<p>He had no prayers to offer up. Meeus would have
to go before his Maker just as he was, and explain
things&mdash;explain all that business away there at the
Silent Pools and other things as well. Prayers over
his tomb or flowers on it would not help that explanation
one little bit.</p>
<p>Then Adams turned away and the soldiers trooped
after him.</p>
<p>He had looked into the office and seen the rifles and
ammunition which they had placed there out of the wet.
A weak man would have locked the office door and so
have deprived the soldiers of their arms, but Adams was
not a weak man.</p>
<p>He led his followers to the office, handed them their
arms, carefully examining each rifle to see that it was
clean and uninjured, drew them up on a line, addressed
them in some more unprintable language but in a milder
tone, dismissed them with a wave of his hand and returned
to the house.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></p>
<p>As he left them the wretched creatures all gave a shout&mdash;a
shout of acclamation.</p>
<p>This was the man for them&mdash;very different from
the pale-faced Meeus&mdash;this was a man they felt who
would lead them to more unspeakable butchery than
Meeus had ever done. Therefore they shouted, piled
their arms in the office and returned to the rebuilding of
their huts with verve.</p>
<p>They were not physiognomists, these gentlemen.</p>
<p>Berselius awoke from sleep at noon, but he was so
weak that he could scarcely move his lips. Fortunately
there were some goats at the fort, and Adams fed him with
goats&#8217; milk from a spoon, just as one feeds an infant.
Then the sick man fell asleep and the rain came down
again&mdash;not in a thunder shower this time, but steadily,
mournfully, playing a tattoo on the zinc roof of the
veranda, filling the place with drizzling sounds, dreary
beyond expression. With the rain came gloom so deep
that Adams had to light the paraffin lamp. There were
no books, no means of recreation, nothing to read but the
old official letters and the half-written report which the
dead man had left on the table before leaving earth to
make his report elsewhere. Adams having glanced at
this, tore it in pieces, then he sat smoking and thinking
and listening to the rain.</p>
<p>Toward night a thunderstorm livened things up a little,
and a howling wind came over the forest on the heels of
the storm.</p>
<p>Adams came out on the veranda to listen.</p>
<p>He could have sworn that a great sea was roaring below
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
in the darkness. He could hear the waves, the boom
and burst of them, the suck-back of the billows tearing
the shrieking shale to their hearts, the profound and
sonorous roar of leagues of coast. Imagination could do
anything with that sound except figure the reality of it or
paint the tremendous forest bending to the wind in billows
of foliage a hundred leagues long; the roar of the cotton-woods,
the cry of the palm, the sigh of the withered euphorbias,
the thunderous drumming of the great plantain leaves,
all joining in one tremendous symphony led by the trumpets
of the wind, broken by rainbursts from the rushing
clouds overhead, and all in viewless darkness, black as
the darkness of the pit.</p>
<p>This was a new phase of the forest, which since the
day Adams entered it first, had steadily been explaining
to him the endlessness of its mystery, its wonder, and
its terror.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
<h3>MOONLIGHT ON THE POOLS</h3>
</div>

<p>Now began for Adams a time of trial, enough to
break the nerve of any ordinary man. Day
followed day and week followed week, Berselius
gaining strength so slowly that his companion began to
despair at last, fancying that the main fountain and
source of life had been injured, and that the stream would
never flow again but in a trickle, to be stopped at the
least shock or obstruction.</p>
<p>The man was too weak to talk, he could just say &#8220;Yes&#8221;
and &#8220;No&#8221; in answer to a question, and it was always
&#8220;Better&#8221; when he was asked how he felt, but he never
spoke a word of his own volition.</p>
<p>Nearly every day it rained, and it rained in a hundred
different ways&mdash;from the thunderous shower-bath rush
of water that threatened to beat the roof in, to the light
spitting shower shone through by the sun. Sometimes
the clouds would divide, roll up in snow-white billows of
appalling height, and over the fuming foliage a rainbow
would form, and flocks of birds, as if released by some
wizard, break from the reeking trees. Adams could hear
their cries as he stood at the foot wall watching them
circle in the air, and his heart went out to them, for they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
were the only living things in the world around him
that spoke in a kindly tongue or hinted at the tenderness
of God.</p>
<p>All else was vast and of tragic proportions. The
very rainbow was titanic; it seemed primeval as the land
over which it stretched and the people to whom it bore
no promise.</p>
<p>But the forest was the thing which filled Adams&#8217;s
heart with a craving for freedom and escape that rose to
a passion.</p>
<p>He had seen it silent in the dry season; he had seen it
divided by the great rain-wall and answering the downpour
with snow-white billows of mist and spray; he had
heard it roaring in the dark; it had trapped him, beaten
him with its wet, green hands, sucked him down in its
quagmires, shown him its latent, slow, but unalterable
ferocity, its gloom, its devilment.</p>
<p>The rubber collector who had helped to carry Berselius
to the fort had gone back to his place and task&mdash;the forest
had sucked him back. This gnome had explained without
speaking what the gloom and the quagmire, and the
rope-like lianas had hinted, what the Silent Pools had
shouted, what the vulture and the kite had laid bare, what
the heart had whispered: <i>There is no God in the forest
of M&#8217;Bonga, no law but the law of the leopard, no mercy
but the mercy of Death.</i></p>
<p>The forest had become for Adams a living nightmare&mdash;his
one desire in life now was to win free of it, and
never did it look more sinister than when, rainbow-arched
and silently fuming, it lay passive, sun-stricken, the palms
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
bursting above the mist and the great clouds rolling away
in billows, as if to expose fully the wonder of those primeval
leagues of tree-tops sunlit, mist-strewn, where the
feathery fingers of the palms made banners of the wrack
and the baobabs held fog-banks in their foliage.</p>
<p>At the end of the third week Berselius showed signs of
amendment. He could raise himself now in bed and
speak. He said little, but it was evident that his memory
had completely returned, and it was evident that he was
still the changed man. The iron-hearted Berselius, the
man of daring and nerve, was not here, he had been left
behind in the elephant country in the immeasurable
south.</p>
<p>The mist had departed entirely from his mind; his
whole past was clear before him, and with his new mind
he could reckon it up and see the bad and the good. The
extraordinary fact was that in reviewing this past he did
not feel terrified&mdash;it seemed a dead thing and almost as
the past of some other man. All those acts seemed to
Berselius to have been committed by a man who was now
dead.</p>
<p>He could regret the acts of that man and he could
seek to atone for them, but he felt no personal remorse.
&#8220;He was not I,&#8221; would have reasoned the mind of Berselius;
&#8220;those acts were not my acts, because <i>now I could
not commit them</i>,&#8221; so he would have reasoned had he
reasoned on the matter at all. But he did not. In that
wild outburst by the Silent Pools the ego had screamed
aloud, raving against itself, raving against the trick that
fate had played it, by making it the slave of two personalities,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
and then torturing it by showing it the acts of the
old personality through the eyes of the new.</p>
<p>When the brain fever had passed, it awoke untroubled;
the junction had been effected, the new Berselius was It,
and all the acts of the old Berselius were foreign to it and
far away.</p>
<p>It is thus the man who gets religion feels when the
great change comes on his brain. After the brain-storm
and the agony of new birth comes the peace and the feeling
that he is &#8220;another man.&#8221; He feels that all his sins
are washed away; in other words, he has lost all sense
of responsibility for the crimes he committed in the old
life, he has cast them off like an old suit of clothes. The
old man is dead. Ah, but is he? Can you atone for
your vices by losing your smell and taste for vice,
and slip out of your debt for crime by becoming
another man?</p>
<p>Does the old man ever die?</p>
<p>The case of Berselius stirs one to ask the question,
which is more especially interesting as it is prompted by
a case not unique but almost typical.</p>
<p>The interesting point in Berselius&#8217;s case lay in the
question as to whether his change of mind was initiated
by the injury received in the elephant country or by the
shock at the Silent Pools. In other words, was it due
to some mechanical pressure on the brain produced by the
accident, or was it due to &#8220;repentance&#8221; on seeing suddenly
unveiled the hideous drama in which he had taken
part?</p>
<p>This remains to be seen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></p>
<p>At the end of the fourth week Berselius was able to
leave his bed, and every day now marked a steady improvement
in strength.</p>
<p>Not a word about the past did he say, not a question
did he ask, and what surprised Adams especially, not
a question did he put about Meeus, till one day in the
middle of the fifth week.</p>
<p>Berselius was seated in one of the arm chairs of the
sitting room when he suddenly raised his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way,&#8221; said he, &#8220;where is the <i>Chef de Poste</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is dead,&#8221; replied Adams.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Berselius; there was almost a note of relief
in his voice. He said nothing more and Adams volunteered
no explanation, for the affair was one entirely
between Meeus, himself, and God.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, Berselius, who seemed deep in
thought, raised his head again.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must get away from here. I am nearly strong
enough to go now. It will be a rough journey in these
rains, but it will be a much shorter road than the road
we came by.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We came from Yandjali right through the forest
before striking south to here; we will now make straight
for the river, along the rubber road. I think the post
on the river which we will reach is called M&#8217;Bina, it is a
hundred miles above Yandjali; we can get a boat from
there to Leopoldsville. I have been thinking it all out
this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about a guide?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></p>
<p>&#8220;These soldiers here know the rubber track, for they
often escort the loads.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Adams. &#8220;I will have some sort of litter
rigged up and we will carry you. I am not going to let
you walk in your present condition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berselius bowed his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very sensible,&#8221; said he, &#8220;of the care and attention
you have bestowed on me during the past weeks.
I owe you a considerable debt, which I will endeavour
to repay, at all events, by following your directions
implicitly. Let the litter be made, and if you will send
me in the corporal of those men, I will talk to him in his
own language and explain what is to be done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Adams, and he went out and found the
corporal and sent him in to Berselius.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; The word was not capacious enough to
express what he felt. Freedom, Light, Humanity, the
sight of a civilized face, for these he ached with a great
longing, and they were all there at the end of the rubber
road, only waiting to be met with.</p>
<p>He went to the fort wall and shook his fist at the forest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another ten days,&#8221; said Adams.</p>
<p>The forest, whose spirit counted time by tens of thousands
of years, waved its branches to the wind.</p>
<p>A spit of rain from a passing cloud hit Adams&#8217;s cheek,
and in the &#8220;hush&#8221; of the trees there seemed a murmur
of derision and the whisper of a threat.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not well to shake your fist at the gods&mdash;in
the open.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adams went back to the house to begin preparations,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
and for the next week he was busy. From some spare
canvas and bamboos in the go-down he made a litter
strong enough to carry Berselius&mdash;he had to do nearly
all the work himself, for the soldiers were utterly useless
as workmen. Then stores had to be arranged and put
together in a convenient form for carrying; clothes had
to be mended and patched&mdash;even his boots had to be
cobbled with twine&mdash;but at last all was ready, and on
the day before they started the weather improved. The
sun came out strong and the clouds drew away right to
the horizon, where they lay piled in white banks like
ranges of snow-covered mountains.</p>
<p>That afternoon, an hour before sunset, Adams
announced his intention of going on a little expedition
of his own.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall only be a few hours away,&#8221; said he, &#8220;five at
most.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; asked Berselius.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, just down into the woods,&#8221; replied Adams.
Then he left the room before his companion could ask
any more questions and sought out the corporal.</p>
<p>He beckoned the savage to follow him, and struck
down the slope in the direction of the Silent Pools. When
they reached the forest edge he pointed before them and
said, &#8220;Matabayo.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man understood and led the way, which was
not difficult, for the feet of the rubber collectors had
beaten a permanent path. There was plenty of light,
too, for the moon was already in the sky, only waiting for
the sun to sink before blazing out.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></p>
<p>When they were half-way on their journey heavy dusk
fell on them suddenly, and deepened almost to dark;
then, nearly as suddenly, all the forest around them glowed
green to the light of the moon.</p>
<p>The Silent Pools and the woods, when they reached
them, lay in mist and moonlight, making a picture unforgettable
for ever.</p>
<p>It recalled to Adams that picture of Doré&#8217;s, illustrating
the scene from the &#8220;Idylls of the King,&#8221; where Arthur
labouring up the pass &#8220;all in a misty moonlight,&#8221; had
trodden on the skeleton of the once king, from whose head
the crown rolled like a rivulet of light down to the tarn&mdash;the
misty tarn, where imagination pictured Death waiting
to receive it and hide it in his robe.</p>
<p>The skeleton of no king lay here, only the poor bones
still unburied of the creatures that a far-off king had
murdered. The rain had washed them about, and
Adams had to search and search before he found what he
had come to find.</p>
<p>At last he saw it. The skull of a child, looking like
a white stone amidst the grass. He wrapped it in leaves
torn from the trees near by, and the grim corporal stood
watching him, and wondering, no doubt, for what fetish
business the white man had come to find the thing.</p>
<p>Then Adams with the dreary bundle under his arm
looked around him at the other remains and swore&mdash;swore
by the God who had made him, by the mother
who had borne him, and the manhood that lay in
him, to rest not nor stay till he had laid before the
face of Europe the skull of Papeete and the acts of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
the terrible scoundrel who for long years had systematically
murdered for money.</p>
<p>Then, followed by the savage, he turned and retook
his road. At the wood&#8217;s edge he looked back at the
silent scene, and it seemed to look at him with the muteness
and sadness of a witness who cannot speak, of a
woman who cannot tell her sorrow.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
<h3>THE RIVER OF GOLD</h3>
</div>

<p>Next morning they started.</p>
<p>The corporal, three of the soldiers, and the
two porters made up the escort.</p>
<p>Berselius, who was strong enough to walk a little way,
began the journey on foot, but they had not gone five
miles on their road when he showed signs of fatigue, and
Adams insisted on him taking to the litter.</p>
<p>It was the same road by which Félix had led them, but
it was very different travelling; where the ground had
been hard underfoot it was now soft, and where it had
been elastic it was now boggy; it was more gloomy, and
the forest was filled with watery voices; where it dipped
down into valleys, you could hear the rushing and mourning
of waters. Tiny trickles of water had become rivulets&mdash;rivulets
streams.</p>
<p>Away in the elephant country it was the same, the dry
river-bed where they had found the carcass of the elephant,
was now the bed of rushing water. The elephant and
antelope herds were wandering in clouds on the plains.
A hundred thousand streams from Tanganyika to Yandjali
were leaping to form rivers flowing for one destination,
the Congo and the sea.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></p>
<p>On the second day of their journey, an accident
happened; one of the porters, released for a spell from
bearing the litter, and loitering behind, was bitten by
a snake.</p>
<p>He died despite all Adams&#8217;s attempts to save him,
and, leaving his body to be buried by the leopards, they
passed on.</p>
<p>But the soldiers, especially the corporal, took the
matter strangely. These bloodthirsty wretches, inured
to death and thinking nothing of it, seemed cast down,
and at the camping place they drew aside, chattered
together for a few minutes, and then the corporal came to
Berselius and began a harangue, his eyes rolling toward
Adams now and then as he proceeded.</p>
<p>Berselius listened, spoke a few words, and then turned
to Adams.</p>
<p>&#8220;He says you have brought something with you that
is unlucky, and that unless you throw it away, we shall
all die.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what he means,&#8221; replied Adams; &#8220;I have
brought a relic from that village by the Silent Pools. I
shall not throw it away. You can tell him so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berselius spoke to the man who still stood sullenly
waiting, and who was opening his mouth to continue
his complaints, when Adams seized him by the shoulders,
turned him round, and with a kick, sent him back to his
companions.</p>
<p>&#8220;You should not have done that,&#8221; said Berselius;
&#8220;these people are very difficult to deal with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Difficult!&#8221; said Adams. He stared at the soldiers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
who were grouped together, slapped the Mauser pistol
at his side, and then pointed to the tent.</p>
<p>The men ceased muttering, and came as beaten dogs
come at the call of their master, seized the tent and put
it up.</p>
<p>But Berselius still shook his head. He knew these
people, their treachery, and their unutterable heartlessness.</p>
<p>&#8220;How far are we from the river now?&#8221; asked Adams,
that night, as they sat by the fire, for which the corporal
by some miracle of savagery had found sufficient dry fuel
in the reeking woods around them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another two days&#8217; march,&#8221; replied Berselius, &#8220;I trust
that we shall reach it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ll get there,&#8221; said Adams, &#8220;and shall I tell
you why? Well, we&#8217;ll get there just because of that relic
I am carrying. God has given me it to take to Europe.
To take to Europe and show to men that they may see
the devilment of this place, and the work of Satan that is
being carried out here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berselius bowed his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you are right,&#8221; said he, at last, slowly and
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Adams said no more. The great change in his
companion stood as a barrier between him and the
loathing he would have felt if Berselius had been still
himself.</p>
<p>The great man had fallen, and was now very low. That
vision of him in his madness by the Silent Pools had placed
him forever on a plane above others. God had dealt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
with this man very visibly, and the hand of God was
still upon him.</p>
<p>Next day they resumed their journey. The soldiers
were cheerful and seemed to have forgotten all about their
grievance, but Berselius felt more uneasy than ever.
He knew these people, and that nothing could move them
to mirth and joy that was not allied to devilment, or
treachery, or death.</p>
<p>But he said nothing, for speech was useless.</p>
<p>Next morning when they woke they found the soldiers
gone; they had taken the porter with them, and as much
of the provisions as they could steal without disturbing
the white men.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought so,&#8221; said Berselius.</p>
<p>Adams raged and stormed, but Berselius was perfectly
calm.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing I fear most,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is that they have
led us out of our road. Did you notice whether we were
in the track for the last mile or so of our journey
yesterday?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Adams, &#8220;I just followed on. Good
God! if it is so we are lost.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, the rubber road was just a track so faint, that
without keeping his eyes on the ground where years of
travel had left just a slight indication of the way, a
European would infallibly lose it. Savages, who have
eyes in their feet, hold it all right, and go along with their
burdens even in the dark.</p>
<p>Adams searched, but he could find no track.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must leave all these things behind us,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
Berselius, pointing to the tent and litter. &#8220;I am strong
enough to walk; we must strike through the forest and
leave the rest to chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which way?&#8221; asked Adams.</p>
<p>&#8220;It does not matter. These men have purposely lost
us, and we do not know in the least the direction of the
river.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adams&#8217;s eyes fell on a bundle wrapped in cloth. It
was the relic.</p>
<p>He knelt down beside it, and carefully removed the
cloth without disturbing the position of the skull.</p>
<p>He noted the direction in which the eye-holes pointed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will go in that direction,&#8221; said he. &#8220;We have
lost ourselves, but God has not lost us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let it be so,&#8221; replied Berselius.</p>
<p>Adams collected what provisions he could carry, tied
the skull to his belt with a piece of rope taken from the
tent, and led the way amidst the trees.</p>
<p>Two days later, at noon, still lost, unutterably weary,
they saw through the trees before them a sight to slay all
hope.</p>
<p>It was the tent and the litter just as they had left them.</p>
<p>Two days&#8217; heart-breaking labour had brought them
to this by all sorts of paths.</p>
<p>They had not wandered in a circle. They had travelled
in segments of circles, and against all mathematical
probability, had struck the camp.</p>
<p>But the camp was not tenantless. Someone was there.
A huge man-like form, a monstrous gorilla, the evil spirit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
that haunted the forest, bent and gray and old-looking,
was picking the things about, sniffing at them, turning
them over.</p>
<p>When they saw him first, he was holding the tent-cloth
between both his hands just as a draper holds a piece of
cloth, then he ripped it up with a rending sound, flung the
pieces away, and began turning over the litter.</p>
<p>He heard the steps of the human beings, and sat up,
looking around him, sniffing the air. He could not see
them, for he was purblind.</p>
<p>The human beings passed on into the terrible nowhere
of the forest.</p>
<p>When you are lost like this, you cannot rest. You
must keep moving, even though you are all but hopeless
of reaching freedom.</p>
<p>Two days later they were still lost, and now entirely
hopeless.</p>
<p>To torment their hearts still more, faint sun-rays came
through the leaves overhead.</p>
<p>The sun was shining overhead; the sun they would never
see again. It was the very end of all things, for they had
not eaten for twelve hours now.</p>
<p>The sun-rays danced, for a breeze had sprung up, and
they could hear it passing free and happily in the leaves
overhead.</p>
<p>Berselius cast himself down by a huge tree and leaned
his head against the bark. Adams stood for a moment
with his hand upon the tree-bole. He knew that when
he had cast himself down he would never rise again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
It was the full stop which would bring the story of his life
to a close.</p>
<p>He was standing like this when, borne on the breeze
above the tree-tops, came a sound, stroke after stroke,
sonorous and clear. The bell of a steamboat!</p>
<p>It was the voice of the Congo telling of Life, Hope,
Relief.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Berselius did not hear it. Sunk in a profound stupor,
he would not even raise his head.</p>
<p>Adams seized his companion in his arms and came
facing the direction of the breeze. He walked like a
man in his sleep, threading the maze of the trees on, on,
on, till before him the day broke in one tremendous splash
of light, and the humble frame-roof of M&#8217;Bina seemed
to him the roofs of some great city, beyond which the
river flowed in sheets of burnished gold.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>
<h3>THE SUBSTITUTE</h3>
</div>

<p>District Commissioner De Wiart, chief
at M&#8217;Bina, was a big man with a blond beard
and a good-natured face. He worked the post
at M&#8217;Bina with the assistance of a subordinate named
Van Laer.</p>
<p>De Wiart was a man eminently fitted for his post. He
had a genius for organization and overseeing. He
would not have been worth a centime away up-country,
for his heart was far too good to allow him to personally
supervise the working of the niggers, but at M&#8217;Bina he
was worth a good deal to the Government that employed
him.</p>
<p>This man who would not hurt a fly&mdash;this man who
would have made an excellent father of a family&mdash;was
terrible to his subordinates when he took a pen in his
hand. He knew the mechanism of every <i>Chef de Poste</i>
in his district, and the sort of letter that would rouse him
up, stimulate him to renewed action, and the slaves under
him to renewed work.</p>
<p>Van Laer was of quite a different type. Van Laer
had the appearance of a famished hound held back by a
leash. He was tall and thin. He had been a schoolmaster
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
dismissed from his school for a grave offence;
he had been a billiard-marker; he had walked the streets
of Brussels in a frock-coat and tall hat, a &#8220;guide&#8221; on the
lookout for young foreigners who wished to enjoy the
more dubious pleasures of the city. He had been many
things, till, at the age of thirty-five, he became a servant
of the crown.</p>
<p>The pale blue eyes of Van Laer held in them a shallowness
and murderous cruelty, an expression of negation
and coldness combined with mind such as one finds
nowhere in the animal kingdom, save that branch of it
which prides itself on its likeness to God. His thumbs
were cruelly shaped and enormous. A man may disguise
his soul, he may disguise his mind, he may disguise
his face, but he cannot disguise his thumbs unless he
wears gloves.</p>
<p>No one wears gloves on the Congo, so Van Laer&#8217;s
thumbs were openly displayed.</p>
<p>He had been six months now at M&#8217;Bina and he was
sick of the place, accounts were of no interest to him.
He was a man of action, and he wanted to be doing. He
could make money up there in the forest at the heart of
things; here, almost in touch with civilization, he was
wasting his time. And he wanted money. The bonus-ache
had seized him badly. When he saw the great tusks
of green ivory in their jackets of matting, when he saw
the bales of copal leafed round with aromatic unknown
leaves, and speaking fervently of the wealth of the tropics
and the riches of the primeval forests, when he saw the
tons of rubber and remembered that this stuff, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
in the baskets of the native collectors looks like fried
potato chips, in Europe becomes, by the alchemy of trade,
minted gold, a great hunger filled his hungry soul.</p>
<p>At M&#8217;Bina great riches were eternally flowing in and
flowing out. Wealth in its original wrappings piled itself
on the wharf in romantical packets and bales, piled itself
on board steamers, floated away down the golden river,
and was replaced by more wealth flowing in from the
inexhaustible forests.</p>
<p>The sight of all this filled Van Laer with an actual
physical hunger. He could have eaten that stuff that
was wealth itself. He could have devoured those tusks.
He was Gargantua as far as his appetite was concerned,
and for the rest he was only Van Laer driving a quill in
the office of De Wiart.</p>
<p>He did not know that he was here on probation; that
the good-natured and seemingly lazy de Wiart was studying
him and finding him satisfactory, that very soon his
desires would be fulfilled, and that he would be let loose
like a beast on the land of his longing, a living whip, an
animated thumb-screw, a knife with a brain in its haft.</p>
<p>When the soldiers had lost Berselius and Adams, they
struck at once for M&#8217;Bina, reaching it in a day&#8217;s march.</p>
<p>Here they told their tale.</p>
<p><i>Chef de Poste</i> Meeus was dead. They had escorted a
sick white man and a big white man toward M&#8217;Bina.
One night three leopards had prowled round the camp
and the soldiers had gone in pursuit of them.</p>
<p>The leopards escaped, but the soldiers could not find
the white men again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></p>
<p>De Wiart listened to this very fishy tale without believing
a word of it, except in so far as it related to Meeus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you lose the white men?&#8221; asked de Wiart.</p>
<p>The soldiers did not know. One does not know where
one loses a thing; if one did, then the thing would not
be lost.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; said De Wiart, agreeing to this very evident
axiom, and more than ever convinced that the story was a
lie. Meeus was dead and the men had come to report.
They had delayed on the road to hold some jamboree of
their own, and this lie about the white men was to account
for their delay.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did anyone else come with you as well as the white
men?&#8221; asked De Wiart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, there was a porter, a Yandjali man. He had
run away.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Wiart pulled his blond beard meditatively, and
looked at the river.</p>
<p>From the office where he was sitting the river, great
with the rains and lit by the sun which had broken through
the clouds, looked like a moving flood of gold. One
might have fancied that all the wealth of the elephant
country, all the teeming riches of the forest, flowing by a
thousand streams and disdaining to wait for the alchemy
of trade, had joined in one Pactolian flood flowing toward
Leopoldsville and the sea.</p>
<p>De Wiart was not thinking this. He dismissed the
soldiers and told them to hold themselves in readiness to
return to M&#8217;Bassa on the morrow.</p>
<p>That evening he called Van Laer into the office.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Chef de Poste</i> Meeus of Fort M&#8217;Bassa is dead,&#8221; said
De Wiart; &#8220;you will go there and take command. You
will start to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Van Laer flushed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a difficult post,&#8221; said De Wiart, &#8220;wild country,
and the natives are the laziest to be found in the whole
of the state. The man before Meeus did much harm;
he had no power or control, he was a weak man,
and the people frankly laughed at him. Actually
rubber came in here one-third rubbish, the people were
half their time in revolt, they cut the vines in two districts.
I have a report of his saying, &#8216;There is no ivory to be
got. The herds are very scarce, and the people say they
cannot make elephants.&#8217; Fancy writing nigger talk like
that in a report. I replied in the same tone. I said,
&#8216;Tell the people they must make them: and make them
in a hurry. Tell them that they need not trouble to make
whole elephants, just the tusks will do&mdash;eighty-pound
tusks, a hundred-pound if possible.&#8217; But sarcasm was
quite thrown away on him. He listened to the natives.
Once a man does that he is lost, for they lose all respect
for him. They are just like children, these people; once
let children get in the habit of making excuses and you
lose control.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meeus was a stronger man, but he left much to be
desired. He had too much whalebone in his composition,
not enough steel, but he was improving.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will find yourself at first in a difficult position.
It always is so when a <i>Chef de Poste</i> dies suddenly and
even a few days elapse before he is replaced. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
people get out of hand, thinking the white man is gone
for ever. However, you will find yourself all right in a
week or so, if you are firm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Van Laer. &#8220;I have no doubt
at all that I will be able to bring these people into line.
I do not boast. I only ask you to keep your eye on the
returns.&#8221;</p>
<p>Next day Van Laer, escorted by the soldiers, left
M&#8217;Bina to take up the station at Fort M&#8217;Bassa left vacant
by the death of <i>Chef de Poste</i> Andreas Meeus.</p>
<p>Three days later at noon De Wiart, drawn from his house
by shouts from the sentinels on duty saw, coming toward
him in the blazing sunshine, a great man who stumbled
and seemed half-blinded by the sunlight, and who was
bearing in his arms another man who seemed dead.</p>
<p>Both were filthy, ragged, torn and bleeding. The
man erect had, tied to his waistbelt by a piece of liana, a
skull.</p>
<p>Fit emblem of the forest he had passed through and
the land that lay behind it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>
<h3>PARIS</h3>
</div>

<p>One hot day in June Schaunard was seated in the
little office just behind his shop. He was
examining an improved telescopic sight which
had just been put upon the market by an opponent,
criticizing it as one poet criticizes the poem of another
poet&mdash;that is to say, ferociously.</p>
<p>To him, thus meditating, from the Rue de la Paix
suddenly came a gush of sound which as suddenly ceased.</p>
<p>The shop door had opened and closed again, and
Schaunard leaving his office came out to see who the
visitor might be.</p>
<p>He found himself face to face with Adams. He knew
him by his size, but he would scarcely have recognized him
by his face, so brown, so thin and so different in expression
was it from the face of the man with whom he had parted
but a few months ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good day,&#8221; said Adams. &#8220;I have come to pay you
for that gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, the gun,&#8221; said Schaunard with a little laugh,
&#8220;this is a pleasant surprise. I had entered it amidst
my bad debts. Come in, monsieur, come into my office,
it is cooler there, and we can talk. The gun, ah, yes. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
had entered that transaction in Ledger D. Come in,
come in. There, take that armchair, I keep it for visitors.
Well, and how did the expedition go off?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Badly,&#8221; said Adams. &#8220;We are only back a week.
You remember what you said to me when we parted?
You said, &#8216;Don&#8217;t go.&#8217; I wish I had taken your advice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, since you are back sound and whole, it seems
to me you have not done so badly&mdash;but perhaps you
have got malaria?&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man&#8217;s sharp eyes were investigating the face
of the other. Schaunard&#8217;s eyes had this peculiarity, that
they were at once friendly to one and cruel, they matched
the eternal little laugh which was ever springing to his
lips&mdash;the laugh of the eternal mocker.</p>
<p>Schaunard made observations as well as telescopic
sights and wind-gauges&mdash;he had been making observation
for sixty years&mdash;he took almost as much interest
in individual human beings as in rifles, and much more
interest in Humanity than in God.</p>
<p>He was afflicted with the malady of the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries&mdash;he did not believe in God, only
instead of hiding his disease under a cloak of mechanical
religion, or temporizing with it, he frankly declared himself
to be what he was, an atheist.</p>
<p>This fact did not interfere with his trade&mdash;a godly
gunmaker gets no more custom than an atheistical one;
besides, Schaunard did not obtrude his religious opinions
after the fashion of his class, he was a good deal of a
gentleman, and he was accustomed to converse familiarly
with emperors and kings.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, it is not malaria,&#8221; replied Adams, following
the old man who was leading the way into the office.
&#8220;I never felt better in my life. It is just the Congo.
The place leaves an impression on one&#8217;s mind, M. Schaunard,
a flavour that is not good.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took the armchair which Schaunard kept for
visitors. He was only a week back&mdash;all he had seen
out there was fresh to him and very vivid, but he felt in
Schaunard an antagonistic spirit, and he did not care to
go deeper into his experiences.</p>
<p>Schaunard took down that grim joke, Ledger D, placed
it on the table and opened it, but without turning the
leaves.</p>
<p>&#8220;And how is Monsieur le Capitaine?&#8221; asked he.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has been very ill, but he is much better. I am
staying with him in the Avenue Malakoff as his medical
attendant. We only arrived at Marseilles a week ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Madame Berselius, how is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Madame Berselius is at Trouville.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The best place this weather. <i>Ma foi</i>, you must
find it warm here even after Africa&mdash;well, tell me how
you found the gun to answer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adams laughed. &#8220;The gun went off&mdash;in the hands
of a savage. All your beautiful guns, Monsieur Schaunard,
are now matchwood and old iron, tents, everything
went, smashed to pieces, pounded to pulp by elephants.&#8221;</p>
<p>He told of the great herd they had pursued and how
in the dark it had charged the camp. He told of how in
the night, listening by the camp fire, he had heard the
mysterious boom of its coming, and of the marvellous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
sight he had watched when Berselius, failing in his attempt
to waken the Zappo Zap, had fronted the oncoming
army of destruction.</p>
<p>Schaunard&#8217;s eyes lit up as he listened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that is a man!&#8221;</p>
<p>The remark brought Adams to a halt.</p>
<p>He had become strangely bound up in Berselius; he
had developed an affection for this man almost brotherly,
and Schaunard&#8217;s remark hit him and made him wince.
For Schaunard employed the present tense.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Adams at last, &#8220;it was very grand.&#8221; Then
he went on to tell of Berselius&#8217;s accident, but he said
nothing of his brain injury, for a physician does not speak
of his patient&#8217;s condition to strangers, except in the
vaguest and most general terms.</p>
<p>&#8220;And how did you like the Belgians?&#8221; asked the old
man, when Adams had finished.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Belgians!&#8221; Adams, suddenly taken off his
guard, exploded; he had said nothing as yet about the
Congo to anyone. He could not help himself now; the
horrors rushed to his mouth and escaped&mdash;the cry of
the great mournful country&mdash;the cry that he had brought
to Europe with him in his heart, found vent.</p>
<p>Schaunard sat amazed, not at the infamies pouring
from Adams&#8217;s mouth, for he was well acquainted with
them, but at the man&#8217;s vehemence and energy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have come to Europe to expose him,&#8221; finished
Adams.</p>
<p>&#8220;Expose who?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Leopold, King of the Belgians.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But, my dear Monsieur Adams, you have come to
waste your time; he is already exposed. Expose Leopold,
King of the Belgians! Say at once that you are
going to expose the sun. He doesn&#8217;t care. He exposes
himself. His public and his private life are common
property.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean to say that everyone knows what I know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Precisely, and perhaps even more, but everyone has
not seen what you have seen, and that&#8217;s all the difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In this way, monsieur; let us suppose that you have
just seen a child run over in the Rue de la Paix. You
come in here and tell me of it; the horror of it is in your
mind, but you cannot convey that horror to me, simply
because I have not seen what you have seen. Still, you
can convey a part of it, for I know the Rue de la Paix, it
is close to me, outside my door, and I know French
children.</p>
<p>&#8220;You come to me and tell me of hideous sights you
have seen in Africa. That does not move me a tenth
so much, for Africa is very far away&mdash;it is, in fact, for
me a geographical expression; the people are niggers I
have never seen, dwelling in a province I have never
heard of. You come to seek sympathy for this people
amongst the French public? Well, I tell you frankly
you are like a man searching in a dark room for a black
hat that is not there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevertheless I shall search.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As monsieur wills, only don&#8217;t knock yourself against
the chairs and tables. Ah, monsieur, monsieur, you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
are young and a medical man. Remain so, and don&#8217;t
lose your years and your prospects fighting the impossible.
Now listen to me, for it is old Schaunard of the Rue de la
Paix who is speaking to you. The man you would
expose, as you term it, is a king to begin with; to go on
with, he is far and away the cleverest king in Christendom.
That man has brains enough to run what you in America
call a department store. Every little detail of his estate
out there, even to the cap guns and rifles of the troops, he
looks after himself; that&#8217;s why it pays. It is a bad-smelling
business, but it doesn&#8217;t poison the nose of Europe,
because it is so far away. Still, smells are brought over
in samples by missionaries and men like you, and people
say &#8216;Faugh!&#8217; Do you think he did not take that into his
consideration when he planned the affair and laid down
the factory? If you think so, you would be vastly mistaken.
He has agents everywhere&mdash;I have met them,
apologists everywhere&mdash;in the Press, in Society, in the
Church. The Roman Catholic Church is entirely his;
he is triple-ringed with politicians, priests, publicists,
and financiers, all holding their noses to keep out the
stench and all singing the <i>Laus Leopold</i> at the top of
their voices.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! you don&#8217;t know Europe. I do, from the Ballplatz
to Willhelmstrasse, from the Winter Palace to the Elysée,
my trade has brought me everywhere, and if you could
see with my eyes, you would see the great, smooth plain
of ice you hope to warm with your poor breath in the name
of Humanity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At all events I shall try,&#8221; replied Adams, rising to go.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, try, but don&#8217;t get frozen in making the trial&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the gun&mdash;well, look here&mdash;you are starting on
another hunting expedition, it seems to me, a more dangerous
one, too, than the last, for there is no forest where
one loses oneself more fatally than the forest of social
reform&mdash;pay me when you come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Adams, laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only if you are successful though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And, see here, in any event come and tell me the
result. <i>Bon jour</i>, monsieur, and a word in your ear&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man was opening the shop door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Schaunard closed his door and retired to his office
to chuckle over his joke, and Adams walked off down the
Rue de la Paix.</p>
<p>Paris was wearing her summer dress; it was the end
of the season, and the streets were thronged with foreigners&mdash;the
Moor from Morocco, in his white burnous,
elbowed the Slav from Moscow; the Eiffel Tower had
become a veritable Tower of Babel; the theatres were
packed, the <i>cafés</i> crowded. Austrian, Russian, English,
and American gold was pouring into the city&mdash;pouring
in ceaselessly from the four corners of the world and
by every great express disgorging at the Gare du Nord,
the Gare de l&#8217;Est, and the Gare de Lyons.</p>
<p>To Adams, fresh from the wilderness and the forest,
fresh from those great, silent, sunlit plains of the elephant
country and the tremendous cavern of the jungle, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
city around him and the sights affected him with vividness
and force.</p>
<p>Here, in the centre of the greatest civilization that the
world has ever seen, he stood fresh from that primeval
land.</p>
<p>He had seen civilization with her mask off, her hair
in disorder, her foot on the body of a naked slave and
the haft of a blood-stained knife between her teeth, he
was watching her now with her mask on, her hair in powder,
Caruso singing to her; sitting amidst her court of
poets, philosophers, churchmen, placemen, politicians,
and financiers.</p>
<p>It was a strange experience.</p>
<p>He took his way down the Rue de Rivoli and then
to the Avenue Malakoff, and as he walked the face of
the philosophic Schaunard faded from his mind and was
replaced by the vision of Maxine Berselius. Opposites
in the world of thought often awaken images one of
the other, just because of the fact that they are opposites.</p>
<p>Maxine was not at Trouville. She had met them at
the railway station on the day of their arrival.</p>
<p><i>La Joconde</i> had been cabled for from Leopoldsville,
and the great yacht had brought them to Marseilles.
Nothing had been cabled as to Berselius&#8217;s accident or
illness, and Madame Berselius had departed for Trouville,
quite unconscious of anything having happened to her
husband.</p>
<p>Maxine was left to discover for herself the change in
her father. She had done so at the very first sight of him,
but as yet she had said no word.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>
<h3>DREAMS</h3>
</div>

<p>When Adams arrived at the Avenue Malakoff
he found Berselius in the library. He was
seated in a big armchair, and M. Pinchon,
his secretary, a man dry-looking as an account-book,
bald, and wearing spectacles, was just leaving the room
with some shorthand notes of business letters to be typed.</p>
<p>Berselius was much changed; his hair was quite gray,
his eyes, once so calm, forceful, and intrinsically brilliant,
had lost their lustre, his face wore the expression of a
confirmed invalid.</p>
<p>Great discontent was the predominant feature of this
expression.</p>
<p>It was only within the last few days that this had
appeared. On recovering from the hardships of the
forest and on the voyage home, though weak enough,
he had been serene, mild, amiable and rather listless,
but during the last few days something was visibly troubling
him.</p>
<p>He had &#8220;gone off,&#8221; to use an expressive phrase sometimes
employed by physicians.</p>
<p>A strange thing had happened to Berselius. Ever
since the recovery of his memory his new self had contemplated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
the past from the heights of new birth, calmly
conscious of the fact that this past belonged to a man
who was dead. The more he examined this past the
more he loathed the man to whom it had belonged, but
the difference between that man and himself was so profound
that he felt, rightly, that he was not <i>He</i>.</p>
<p>Three mornings ago Berselius, who rarely dreamt,
had awakened from a long night of hunting in Dreamland.
In Dreamland he had cast off his new personality
and became his old self, and then, in his hunting
shirt and with a cordite rifle in his hand, accompanied
by the Zappo Zap, he had tracked elephant herds across
illimitable plains.</p>
<p>He had awakened to his new self again with the full
recognition in his mind that only a few moments ago he
had been thinking with that other man&#8217;s brain, acting
under his passions, living his life.</p>
<p>The Berselius of Dreamland had not the remotest
connection with, or knowledge of, the Berselius of real
life. Yet the Berselius of real life was very intimately
connected with the Berselius of Dreamland, knew all his
actions, knew all his sensations, and remembered them
to the minutest detail.</p>
<p>The next night he did not dream at all&mdash;not so on
the third night, when the scene of horror by the Silent
Pools was reenacted, himself in the original <i>role</i>. The
incidents were not quite the same, for scenes from real
life are scarcely ever reproduced on the stage of Dreamland
in their entirety; but they were ghastly enough in
all conscience, and Berselius, awake and wiping the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
sweat from his brow, saw them clearly before him and
remembered the callousness with which he had watched
them but a few moments ago.</p>
<p>No man can command his dreams; the dreaming man
lives in a world beyond law, and it came as a shock to
Berselius that his old self should be alive in him like this,
powerful, active, and beyond rebuke.</p>
<p>Physically, he was a wreck of his old self, but that was
nothing to the fact which was now borne in on him&mdash;the
fact that this new mentality was but a thin shell
covering the old, as the thin shell of earth, with its flowers
and pleasant landscapes, covers the burning hell which
is the earth&#8217;s core.</p>
<p>The thing was perfectly natural. A great and vivid
personality, and forty years of exuberant and self-willed
life had at a stroke been checked and changed. The
crust of his mind had cooled; tempestuous passions had
passed from the surface, giving place to kindlier emotions,
but the furnace was there beneath the flower garden
just as it is in the case of the earth.</p>
<p>Captain Berselius was still alive, though suppressed
and living in secrecy. At night, touched by the magic
wand of sleep, he became awake, and became supreme
master of the tenement in the cellars of which he was
condemned to sleep by day.</p>
<p>So far from having been touched by death, Captain
Berselius was now secure from death or change; a thing
not to be reasoned with or altered&mdash;beyond human
control&mdash;yet vividly alive as the fabled monster that
inhabits the cellars of Glamis Castle.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></p>
<p>Between the dual personalities of the man complete
fission had taken place, a terrible accident of the sort
condemning the cast-off personality to live in darkness
beyond the voice of mind or amendment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Adams, as he entered the room. &#8220;How
are you to-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, about the same, about the same. If I could
sleep properly I would mend, but my sleep is broken.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must give you something to alter that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berselius laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drugs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, drugs. We doctors cannot always command
health, but we can command sleep. Do you feel yourself
able to talk for a bit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I feel physically well. Sit down, you will
find some cigars in that cabinet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adams lit a cigar and took his seat in an armchair
close to his companion. All differences of rank and
wealth were sunk between these two men who had gone
through so much together. On their return, when
Berselius had desired Adams to remain as his medical
attendant, he had delegated M. Pinchon as intermediary
to deal with Adams as to the financial side of the
question.</p>
<p>Adams received a large salary paid monthly in advance
by the secretary. Berselius did not have any hand in
the matter, thus the feeling of employer and employed
was reduced to vanishing point and the position rendered
more equal.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; said Adams, &#8220;I have always been glad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
to do anything I can for you, and I always shall be, but
since I have come back to Paris I have been filled with
unrest. You complain of sleeplessness&mdash;well, that is my
disease.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that place over there; it has got into my blood.
I declare to God that I am the last man in the world to
sentimentalize, but that horror is killing me, and I must
act&mdash;I must do something&mdash;even if I have to go into
the middle of the Place de la Concorde and shout it aloud.
I shall shout it aloud. I&#8217;m not made so that I can
stand seeing a thing like that in silence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berselius sat with his eyes fixed on the carpet; he
seemed abstracted and scarcely listening. He knew
perfectly well that Adams was acquainted with the
affair at the Silent Pools, but the subject had never been
mentioned between them, nor was it now.</p>
<p>&#8220;That missionary I met on the return home at Leopoldsville,&#8221;
went on Adams, &#8220;he was a Baptist, a man, not a
religion-machine. He gave me details from years of
experience that turned my heart in me. With my own
eyes I saw enough&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Berselius held up his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us not speak of what we know,&#8221; said he. &#8220;The
thing is there&mdash;has been there for years&mdash;can you
destroy the past?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; but one can improve the future.&#8221; Adams
got up and paced the floor. &#8220;Now, now as I am talking to
you, that villainy is going on; it is like knowing that a
murder is slowly being committed in the next house
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
and that one has no power to interfere. When I look at
the streets full of people amusing themselves; when I
see the <i>cafés</i> crammed, and the rich driving in their carriages;
the churches filled with worshippers worshipping
a God who serenely sits in heaven without stretching
a hand to help His poor, benighted creatures&mdash;when
I see all this and contrast it with what I have seen,
I could worship <i>that</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped, and pointed to the great gorilla shot years
ago in German West Africa by Berselius. &#8220;That was
a being at least sincere. Whatever brutalities he committed
in his life, he did not talk sentiment and religion
and humanitarianism as he pulled his victims to pieces,
and he did not pull his victims to pieces for the sake of
gold. He was an honest devil, a far higher thing than
a dishonest man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Berselius held up his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do? I&#8217;d break that infernal machine which calls
itself a State, and I&#8217;d guillotine the ruffian that invented
it. I cannot do that, but I can at least protest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berselius, who had helped to make the machine, and
who knew better than most men its strength, shook
his head sadly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do what you will,&#8221; said he. &#8220;If you need money
my funds are at your disposal, but you cannot destroy
the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adams, who knew nothing of Berselius&#8217;s dream-obsession,
could not understand the full meaning of
these words.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></p>
<p>But he had received permission to act, and the promise
of that financial support without which individual
action would be of no avail.</p>
<p>He determined to act; he determined to spare neither
Berselius&#8217;s money nor his own time.</p>
<p>But the determination of man is limited by circumstance,
and circumstance was at that moment preparing
and rehearsing the last act of the drama of Berselius.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>
<h3>BERSELIUS BEHOLDS HIS OTHER SELF</h3>
</div>

<p>On the morning after Berselius&#8217;s conversation
with Adams, Berselius left the Avenue Malakoff,
taking his way to the Avenue des Champs
Elysées on foot.</p>
<p>The change in the man was apparent even in his
walk. In the old days he was rapid in his movements,
erect of head, keen of eye. The weight of fifteen years
seemed to have suddenly fallen on his shoulders, bowing
them and slowing his step. He was in reality
carrying the most terrible burden that a man can
carry&mdash;himself.</p>
<p>A self that was dead, yet with which he had to live.
A past which broke continually up through his dreams.</p>
<p>He was filled with profound unrest, irritation and revolt;
everything connected with that other one, even the money
he had made and the house he had built for himself and the
pursuits he had followed, increased this irritation and
revolt. He had already formed plans for taking a new
house in Paris, but to-day, as he walked along the streets,
he recognized that Paris itself was a house, every corner of
which belonged to that other one&#8217;s past.</p>
<p>In the Avenue Champs Elysées, he hailed a <i>fiacre</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
and drove to the house of his lawyer, M. Cambon, which
was situated in the Rue d&#8217;Artiles.</p>
<p>Cambon had practically retired from his business, which
was carried on now by his son. But for a few old and
powerful clients, such as Berselius, he still acted personally.</p>
<p>He was at home, and Berselius was shown into a drawing
room, furnished heavily after the heart of the prosperous
French <i>bourgeois</i>.</p>
<p>He had not to wait long for the appearance of the
lawyer, a fat, pale-faced gentleman, wearing gold-rimmed
spectacles, tightly buttoned up in a frock-coat, the buttonhole
of which was adorned with the red rosette of the
Legion of Honour.</p>
<p>Cambon had known Berselius for years. The two
men were friends, and even more, for Cambon was the
depository of Berselius&#8217;s most confidential affairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the lawyer, &#8220;you have returned. I saw
a notice of your return in the <i>Echo de Paris</i>, and indeed,
this very day I had promised myself the pleasure of calling
on you. And how is Madame Berselius?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is at Trouville.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had it in my mind that you proposed to remain away
twelve months.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but our expedition came to an end.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berselius, in a few words, told how the camp had
been broken up, without referring, however, to his accident;
and the fat and placid Cambon listened, pleased as a child
with the tale. He had never seen an elephant except at
the Jardin d&#8217;Acclimatation. He would have run from a
milch-cow. Terrible in the law courts, in life he was the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
mildest of creatures, and the tale had all the attraction
that the strong has for the weak and the ferocious for the
mild.</p>
<p>But even as he listened, sitting there in his armchair,
he was examining his visitor with minute attention, trying
to discover some clue to the meaning of the change in him.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said Berselius, when he had finished, &#8220;to
business.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had several matters to consult the lawyer about,
and the most important was the shifting of his money
from the securities in which they were placed.</p>
<p>Cambon, who was a large holder of rubber industries,
grew pale beneath his natural pallor when he discovered
that Berselius was about to place his entire fortune elsewhere.</p>
<p>Instantly he put two and two together. Berselius&#8217;s
quick return, his changed appearance, the fact that
suddenly and at one sweep he was selling his stock. All
these pointed to one fact&mdash;disaster.</p>
<p>The elephant story was all a lie, so resolved Cambon,
and, no sooner had he bowed his visitor out, than he rushed
to the telephone, rang up his broker, and ordered him to
sell out his rubber stock at any price.</p>
<p>Berselius, when he left the lawyer&#8217;s house, drove to his
club. The selling of his rubber industry shares had been
prompted by no feeling of compunction; it was an act
entirely dictated by the profound irritation he felt against
the other one who had made his fortune out of those same
rubber industries.</p>
<p>He wished to break every bond between himself and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
infernal entity that dominated him by night. Surely it
was enough to be that other one at night, without being
perpetually haunted by that other one&#8217;s traces by day.</p>
<p>In the Place de L&#8217;Opera, his <i>fiacre</i> paused in a crowd
of vehicles. Berselius heard himself hailed. He turned
his head. In a barouche drawn up beside his carriage,
was seated a young and pretty woman. It was Sophia
Melmotte, a flame from his past life, burning now for a
space in the life of a Russian prince.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Ma foi</i>,&#8221; said Sophia, as her carriage pushed up till
it was quite level with Berselius. &#8220;So you are back from&mdash;where
was it you went to? And how are the tigers?
Why, heavens, how you are changed! How gloomy you
look. One would think you had swallowed a hearse and
had not digested the trappings&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>To all of which Berselius bowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> are just the same as ever,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>The woman flushed under her rouge, for there was
something in Berselius&#8217;s tone that made the simple words an
insult. Before she could reply, however, the block in the
traffic ceased, and as the carriage drove on Berselius
bowed again to her coldly, and as though she were a
stranger with whom he had spoken for a moment, and
whom he had never seen before.</p>
<p>At the club in the smoking room, where he went for an
absinthe before luncheon, he met Colonel Tirard, the very
man who had presided at the banquet given to him on the
day of his leaving for Africa. This man, who had been his
friend, this man, in whose society he had always felt pleasure,
was now obnoxious to him. And after a while the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
weird fact was borne in on the mind of Berselius that Tirard
was not talking to him. Tirard was talking to the man
who was dead&mdash;the other Berselius. The new rifle for
the army, which filled Tirard&#8217;s conversation, would have
been an interesting subject to the old Berselius; it was
absolutely distasteful to the new.</p>
<p>Now, for the first time, he quite clearly recognized
that all the friends, pursuits, and interests that had filled
his life till this, were useless to him and dead as the cast-off
self that had once dominated his being. Not only
useless and dead, but distasteful in a high degree. He
would have to re-create a world of interests for himself
out of new media. He was living in a world where all the
fruit and foliage and crops had been blighted by
some wizard&#8217;s wand; he would have to re-plant it over
anew, and at the present moment he did not know where
to cast about him for a single seed.</p>
<p>Yet he did not give in all at once. Like a person persisting
in some disagreeable medicine, hoping to become
accustomed to it, he continued his conversation with
Tirard.</p>
<p>After luncheon, he sat down to a game of écarté in the
card-room with an old acquaintance, but after half an
hour&#8217;s play he left the table on the plea of indisposition and
left the club, taking his way homeward on foot.</p>
<p>Near the Madeleine occurred one of those incidents
which, in tragic lives, appear less incidents than occurrences
prepared by Fate, as though she would say, &#8220;Look
and deny me if you dare.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toward Berselius was approaching a victoria drawn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
by two magnificent horses, and in the victoria lolled a man.
An old man with a gray beard, who lolled on the cushions
of the carriage, and looked about him with the languid
indifference of a king and the arrogance of a megalomaniac.</p>
<p>It was Leopold, King of the Belgians.</p>
<p>When Berselius&#8217;s eyes fell upon that face, when he
saw before him that man whom all thinking men abhor,
a cold hand seemed laid upon his heart, as though in that
person he beheld the dead self that haunted his dreams
by night, as though he saw in the flesh Berselius, the murderer,
who, by consent, had murdered the people of the
Silent Pools; the murderer, by consent, who had crushed
millions of wretched creatures to death for the sake of
gold; the villain of Europe, who had spent that gold in
nameless debauchery; the man whose crimes ought to
have been expiated on the scaffold, and whose life ought
to have been cut short by the executioner of justice, many,
many years ago.</p>
<p>It was thus at one stroke that Berselius saw his other
self, the self that haunted him in his dreams, saw it clearly,
and in the light of day.</p>
<p>The terrible old man in the carriage passed on his way
and Berselius on his.</p>
<p>When he reached home, in the hall, just as he was handing
his hat to a servant, Maxine appeared at the door of the
library. Her beauty, innocence, and sweetness formed a
strange vision contrasted with that other vision he had seen
near the Madeleine. Was it possible that God&#8217;s world
could hold two such creatures, and that God&#8217;s air should
give them breath? For a week or ten days after this,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
Berselius remained in his own suite of apartments without
leaving the house.</p>
<p>It was as if the sight of Leopold, so triumphantly alive,
had shown him fully his own change and his weakness
had demonstrated to him clearly that he was but the
wraith of what he had been.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>
<h3>THE REVOLT OF A SLAVE</h3>
</div>

<p>The day after that on which Berselius had seen
Leopold, Madame Berselius, moved by one of
those fits of caprice common to women of her
type, came back suddenly from Trouville.</p>
<p>She knew of her husband&#8217;s return, but she knew nothing
of the injury or of the alteration that had come in
him until Maxine, who met her at the station, hinted
at the fact. Berselius was standing at the window of
his private sitting room when Madame Berselius was
announced.</p>
<p>He turned to greet her; even as he turned she perceived
the change. This was not the man who had
left her a few months ago, strong, confident, impassive;
the man who had been her master and before whom she
had shrunk like a slave. Intuition told her that the
change was not the change wrought by sickness&mdash;Berselius
was not ill, he was gone, leaving another man
in his place. They conversed for some time on indifferent
matters, and then Madame Berselius took her
departure for her own apartments.</p>
<p>But she left the room of Berselius a changed woman,
just as he had returned to it a changed man.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span></p>
<p>The slave in her had found her freedom. Utterly
without the capacity for love and without honour, without
conscience and with a vague superstition to serve
for religion, Madame Berselius had, up to this, been
held in her place by the fear of her husband. His will
up to this had been her law; she had moved in the major
affairs of life under his direction, and even in the minor
affairs of life everything had to be surrendered at his
word.</p>
<p>And now she hated him.</p>
<p>She had never hated him before, she had admired him;
indeed, as far as her power of admiration went, his
strength had appealed to her as only strength can
appeal to a woman of her type; but now that his strength
was gone hatred of him rose up in her heart, petty yet
powerful, a dwarf passion that had been slumbering
for years.</p>
<p>When the engine seizes the engineer in its wheels,
when the slave gets power over his master, cruel things
happen, and they were to happen in the case of Berselius.</p>
<p>Madame&#8217;s rooms were so far away from the rooms of
her husband that they might have been living in different
houses. There was none of the intimacy of married
life between this couple; they met formally at meal
times, and it was at <i>déjeuner</i> on the morning after her
return that she showed openly before Adams, Maxine,
and the servants her contempt for the man who had once
held her in subjection. Without a rude word, simply
by her manner, her tone, and her indifference to him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
she humbled to the dust the stricken man and proclaimed
the full measure of his disaster.</p>
<p>As day followed day the dominance of the woman
and the subjection of the man became more marked.
Madame would, if the spirit took her, countermand her
husband&#8217;s orders; once, with absolute rudeness, she, at
table and before the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who
was a guest, turned to ridicule a remark which Berselius
had let escape. The flush that came to his cheek told
Maxine that her father&#8217;s sensibilities were not dead&mdash;he
was dominated.</p>
<p>Nothing could be stranger than this reduction of a
man from greatness to insignificance. The old Berselius
dying, bound in chains, would have mastered this woman
with one glance of his eye. The new Berselius, free,
wealthy, and with all his material powers at command,
was yet her creature, an object of pity to his daughter
and of derision to his servants.</p>
<p>Eight days after her return Madame Berselius, now
free and her own mistress, left Paris for Vaux on a
short visit to some friends, little dreaming of the momentous
event that was to cause her return.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX</h2>
<h3>MAXINE</h3>
</div>

<p>On the night of the day upon which Berselius
had paid his visit to M. Cambon, Adams, seated
in the smoking room at a writing table before
a broad sheet of white paper covered with words,
suddenly took the paper, tore it up, and threw the pieces
in a wastepaper-basket.</p>
<p>He had been trying to put in language the story of
the Congo as it had been revealed to him.</p>
<p>It was all there in his mind like a tremendous dramatic
poem: the great sunlit spaces of the elephant country
watched over by the vultures, the eternal and illimitable
forests old as Memnon, young as Spring, unwithered
and unbroken by the suns and rains and storms of the
ages; the river flooding to the sea, and the people to whom
this place belonged, and the story of their misery and
despair.</p>
<p>When he contrasted what he had written with what
was in his mind, he recognized the hopelessness of his
attempt. He had not the power to put on paper more
than the shadow of what he had seen and of what he knew.</p>
<p>To represent that people under the heel of that Fate
was a task for an Æschylus.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></p>
<p>Sitting thus before the picture he could not reproduce,
there rose before his mind another picture he had seen
that day. It was a large photograph of the Laocoon.
He had seen it in Brentano&#8217;s window, and, now, with the
eye of memory, he was looking at it again.</p>
<p>That wonderful work of art washed up to us by the
ages, that epic in marble, expressed all that words refused
to say: the father and the children in the toils of Fate;
the hand upholding for a moment the crushing coil of
the serpent, the face raised to a sky devoid of God or pity;
the agony, the sweat and the cruelty, all were there; and
as Adams gazed, the python-like lianas of the forest
became alive in his mind, the snake-like rubber vine
twined in coils, circling about and crushing a nation and
its children, remote from help and from God, as Laocoon
and his sons.</p>
<p>Ages have passed since the sculptor of that marble
laid down his chisel and gazed at his completed work.
Little dreamt he that thousands of years later it would
stand as a parable, representing civilization in the form of
the python which he had carved with such loathing yet
such loving care.</p>
<p>Adams, in the grasp of this startling thought, was
recalled from reverie by a sound behind him.</p>
<p>Someone had entered the room. It was Maxine
Berselius.</p>
<p>They had seen very little of each other since his return.
Adams, indeed, had purposely avoided her as much as
it is possible for one person to avoid another when both
are dwelling in the same house.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></p>
<p>The pride of manhood warned him against this woman
who was rich and the daughter of the man from whom
he received a salary.</p>
<p>Maxine knew nothing of the pride of manhood; she
only knew that he avoided her.</p>
<p>She was dressed entirely in white with a row of pearls
for her only ornament. She had just returned from some
social function, and Adams as he rose to meet her noticed
that she had closed the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Adams,&#8221; said the girl, &#8220;forgive me for disturbing
you at this hour. For days I have wished to speak
to you about my father. I have put it off, but I feel I
must speak&mdash;what has happened to him?&#8221;</p>
<p>She took a seat in an armchair, and Adams stood before
her with his back to the mantelpiece and his hands
behind him.</p>
<p>The big man did not answer for a moment. He
stood there like a statue, looking at his questioner gravely
and contemplatively, as a physician looks at a patient
whose case is not quite clear.</p>
<p>Then he said, &#8220;You notice a change in your father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Maxine, &#8220;it is more than a change. He
is quite different&mdash;he is another man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When we were hunting out there,&#8221; said Adams,
&#8220;Captain Berselius had an accident. In trying to rescue
a servant he was caught by an elephant and flung some
distance; he hurt his head, and when he recovered consciousness
his memory was quite gone. It slowly returned&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He
paused, for it was impossible to give details,
then he went on&mdash;&#8220;I noticed, myself, as the memory
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
was returning, that he seemed changed; when he had
fully recovered his memory, the fact was obvious. He
was, as you say, quite different&mdash;in fact, just as you see
him now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But can an injury change a person like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; an injury to the head can change a person
completely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maxine sighed. She had never seen the dark side of
her father; she had never loved him in the true sense of
the word, but she had respected him and felt a pride
in his strength and dominance.</p>
<p>The man who had returned from Africa seemed to
her an inferior being; the wreck, in fact, of the man she
had always known.</p>
<p>&#8220;And this happened to him,&#8221; said she, &#8220;when he
was trying to save a servant&#8217;s life?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Adams, &#8220;if you could have seen it, you
would have called it something even higher than that&mdash;it
was a sublime act.&#8221;</p>
<p>He told her the details, even as he had told them
to Schaunard, but with additions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I myself was paralyzed&mdash;I could only cling to the
tree and watch. The fury of that storm of beasts coming
down on one was like a wind&mdash;I can put it no other
way&mdash;like a wind that stripped one&#8217;s mind of everything
but just the power of sight. I can imagine now
the last day, when the sun shall be turned into darkness
and the moon into blood. It was as bad as that&mdash;well,
<i>he</i> did not lose his mind or nerve, he found time
to think of the man who was lying drugged with hemp,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
and he found courage enough in his heart to attempt
to save him. He was fond of the man, for the man was
a great hunter though an absolute savage, without heart
or soul.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without heart or soul&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Adams paused. There
was something about Maxine Berselius that made her
different from the ordinary woman one meets in life&mdash;some
inheritance from her father, perhaps, who knows?
But through the sweetness of her nature which spoke
in voice and expression, through her loveliness and her
womanliness, there shone a light from within. Like
the gleam from the lamp that lives in an opal, this mind-brightness
of Maxine&#8217;s pierced the clouds of her beauty
capriciously, now half-veiled, now shining forth. It
was the light of that flame which men call originality.
Maxine saw the world by the light of her own lamp.
Adams, though he had seen far more of the world than she,
had seen it by the light of other people&#8217;s lamps.</p>
<p>The Hostage House of Yandjali would have told
Maxine infinitely more than it told Adams. She would
have read in Meeus&#8217;s face a story that he never deciphered;
she would have seen in the people of the Silent Pools a
whole nation in chains, when he with his other-people-begotten
ideas of niggers and labour only saw a few
recalcitrant blacks. It wanted skulls and bones to bring
him to a sense of the sorrow around him; the sight of
these people would have told Maxine of their tears.</p>
<p>This instinct for the truth of things made her a reader
of people. Adams had interested her at first sight,
because she found him difficult to read. She had never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
met a man like him before; he belonged to a different
race. The man in him appealed powerfully to the
woman in her; they were physical affinities. She had
told him this in a hundred ways half unconsciously and
without speech before they parted at Marseilles, but the
mind in him had not appealed to the mind in her. She
did not know his mind, its stature or its bent, and until
that knowledge came to her she could not love him.</p>
<p>As he stood with his back to the fireplace after that
pronouncement on the spiritual and moral condition of
the Zappo Zap, his thoughts strayed for a moment with
a waft of the wing right across the world to the camping
place by the great tree. Out there now, under the
stars, the tree and the pool were lying just as he had seen
them last. Away to the east the burst elephant gun was
resting just where it had been dropped; the bones of the
giraffe, clean-picked and white, were lying just where
the gun had laid them; and the bones of the man who
had held the gun were lying just where the leopards had
left him.</p>
<p>Adams knew nothing of this triangle drawn by death;
he still fancied the Zappo Zap alive and deadly. Stirred
into speech by that thought he went on:</p>
<p>&#8220;A cannibal&mdash;a creature worse than a tiger&mdash;that
was the being for whom your father risked his life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A cannibal?&#8221; said Maxine, opening her eyes wide.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; a soldier of the Government who was detailed
to act as our guide.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A soldier&mdash;but what Government employs cannibals
as soldiers?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Adams, &#8220;they call them soldiers, that is
just a name. Slave drivers is the real name, but the
Government that employs them does not use the word
slave&mdash;oh, no, everyone would be shocked&mdash;<i>scoundrels</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>He spoke the word with suddenly flashing eyes, uplifted
head, and a face as stern the face of Themis. He seemed
for a moment fronting some invisible foe, then, smothering
his wrath, he went on:</p>
<p>&#8220;I lose control of myself when I think of what I have
seen&mdash;the suffering, the misery, and the wretchedness.
I saw enough at first to have made me open my eyes, but
the thing was not shown to me really till I saw the bones of
murdered people&mdash;people whom I had seen walking
about alive&mdash;lying there a few weeks later, just skeletons;
a little child I had talked to and played with&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped and turned to the fireplace and rested
his elbow on the mantel. He had turned his back on
Maxine, and volumes could not have said more than what
was expressed by that abrupt stoppage of speech and
turning away.</p>
<p>The girl scarcely breathed till the man turned from the
mantelpiece and faced her again. There was no trace
of emotion on his face, but the trace of a struggle with it.
Maxine&#8217;s eyes were filled with tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that I should have dragged
this subject before you at all. Why should I torment
your heart as well as my own?&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not reply for a moment. She was tracing the
vague pattern of the carpet with her eyes, her chin resting
on her hand, and the light from above made a halo
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
of the burnished red-gold hair that was her crowning
charm.</p>
<p>Then she said, speaking slowly, &#8220;I am not sorry.
Surely if such things are, they ought to be known. Why
should I turn away my face from suffering? I have
never done so in Paris, and I have seen much of the
misery of Paris, for I have gone amongst it as much as
a girl can, but what you tell me is beyond what I have
ever heard of, or read of, or dreamed. Tell me more,
give me facts; for, frankly, though I believe you, I cannot
yet fully realize, and with my mind fully believe.
I am like Thomas; I must put my fingers in the wounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you brave enough to look at material evidence?&#8221;
asked Adams.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; brave enough to face the suffering of others
if not my own&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He left the room and in a few minutes later returned
with a parcel. He took from it the skull he had brought
with him through everything to civilization.</p>
<p>Maxine&#8217;s eyes dilated when she saw the thing, but
she did not turn pale, and she looked steadfastly at it
as Adams turned it in his hands and showed her by
the <i>foramen magnum</i> the hacks in the bone caused by
the knife.</p>
<p>She put out her finger and touched them, then she
said, &#8220;I believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adams put the skull on the table; curious and small
and ferocious and repellent it looked. One would
never have imagined the black face, the grin, and the
rolling eyes of the creature to whom it had once belonged.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
One thing only about it touched the heart with sadness&mdash;its
size.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a child&#8217;s,&#8221; said Maxine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; the child I told you of&mdash;all that remains of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was about to wrap the thing up again when the girl
interposed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let it lie there whilst you tell me; it will bring things
nearer to me. I am not afraid of it&mdash;poor, poor creature.
Tell me all you know&mdash;tell me the worst. I am not a
young lady for the moment, please, just a person listening.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took his seat in an armchair opposite to her, and
resting his elbows on his knees, talking just as if he were
talking to a man, found the words he could not find when,
pen in hand, half an hour ago, he had tried to express
himself in writing.</p>
<p>He told of the Hostage House at Yandjali, and the
wretched creatures penned like animals eating their
miserable food; he told of M&#8217;Bassa and the Hostage
House there, with its iron rings and chains; he told how
all over that vast country these places were dotted, not
by the hundred but by the thousand; he told of the misery
of the men who were driven into the dismal forests, slaves
of masters worse than tigers, and of a task that would
never end as long as rubber grew and Christ was a name
in Europe and not a power; he told the awful fact that
murder there was used every day as an agricultural
implement, that people were operated upon, and suffered
amputation of limbs, not because of disease; and
that their sex and age&mdash;those two last appeals of Nature
to brutality&mdash;had no voice; he told the whole bitter tale
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
of tears and blood, but he could not tell her all, for she
was a girl, and it would be hard to speak even before
a man of the crimes against Nature, the crimes against
men, against women, and against children, that even if
the Congo State were swept away to-morrow, will leave
Belgium&#8217;s name in the world&#8217;s history more detestable
than the names of the unspeakable cities sunk in the
Dead Sea.</p>
<p>Maxine listened, entranced, swayed between the terror
of the tale and the power of the man who was telling it.</p>
<p>Ah! if he could have spoken to Europe as he spoke
to her; if he could have made Europe see as he made her
see, what a whirlwind of indignation would have arisen;
but he could not.</p>
<p>It was the magnet of her sympathy that marshalled
the facts, clad them in burning language, and led them
forth in battalions that stormed her mind and made her
believe what seemed unbelievable. Without that sympathy,
his words would have been cold and lifeless statements
bearing little conviction.</p>
<p>When he had finished, she did that which a woman
never does unless moved by the very highest excitement.
She rose up and paced the floor thrice. Without speaking,
she walked the length of the room, then she turned
to Adams.</p>
<p>&#8220;But this must cease.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This shall cease,&#8221; said he, &#8220;if I can only make myself
heard. To-day&mdash;to-night&mdash;just before you came in,
I was trying to put the thing on paper&mdash;trying to put
down what I have seen with my own eyes, and heard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
with my own ears, but the ink seems ice. What I write
seems nothing, nothing beside what I have seen. The
mere statement that so many were killed, so many were
tortured, conveys nothing of the reality. The thing is
too big for me. God made it, I suppose; but I wish to
God I had never seen it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maxine was standing now with her hands resting
on the back of an armchair. She seemed scarcely listening
to what her companion was saying. She was
listening, but she was thinking as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;You cannot do everything yourself,&#8221; said she, at
last. &#8220;You must get others to help, and in this I can,
perhaps, assist you. Will you go to-morrow and see
Monsieur Pugin? I do not know him personally, but I
know a friend of his. I will send him a note early
to-morrow morning, and the servant can bring back the
letter of introduction. You could call upon him to-morrow
afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is Monsieur Pugin?&#8221;</p>
<p>This question, showing such a boundless ignorance
of every-day French life and literature, rather shocked
Maxine. She explained that Ary Pugin, the author of
&#8220;Absolution&#8221; and twenty other works equally beautiful,
was above all other men fitted to bring home to France
the story of this great sin. &#8220;Absolution,&#8221; that masterpiece,
had shown France her cruelty in the expulsion of the
religious orders. France had read it weeping, drying
her tears with one hand and continuing the expulsion
of the religious orders with the other.</p>
<p>That, however, was not Pugin&#8217;s fault; he had done
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
his best. It was not his fault that logic and sentiment
are so largely constituent of the French nature, making
between them that paradox, the French mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go and see him,&#8221; said Adams, when the girl
had explained what Pugin was, what Pugin did, and what
Pugin had written. &#8220;A man like that could do more
with a stroke of his pen, than I with weary years
of blundering attempts to write. I can never thank
you enough for listening to me. It is strange, but
half the weight of the thing seems to have passed from
my mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To mine,&#8221; she replied. Then, with charming <i>naïveté</i>,
she held out both hands to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he held the door open, and as she passed out, he
realized that, during the last few months, his faith in the
goodness of God&mdash;the old simple faith of his childhood&mdash;had
been all but stolen by ferocious and fiendish hands
from his mind, and that just now, in some miraculous way,
it had been returned.</p>
<p>It was as though the gentle hands of Maxine had put
it back.</p>
<p>Maxine, when she reached her own apartments, turned
on the electric light in her sitting room, and sat down at
once to write to the friend who was a friend of Pugin&#8217;s.</p>
<p>This friend was Sabatier.</p>
<p>She had studied art under him, and between artist
and pupil lay that mysterious bond which unites craftsmen.
For Maxine was great in knowledge and power,
and above all in that instinct without which an artist
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
is at best an animated brush, a pencil under the dominion
of mechanical force.</p>
<p>As she wrote, she little dreamed that the sympathy
burning in her heart and moving to eloquence her pen,
was a thing born not from the sufferings of an afflicted
people, but of the love of a man. A child of her mind
begotten by the man she had just left, and whom, that
night, she had learned to love.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL</h2>
<h3>PUGIN</h3>
</div>

<p>Pugin lived in the Boulevard Haussmann. He
had begun life quite low down in the Parisian
world on the quays as apprentice to Manasis,
a jew book-dealer, who has been dead twenty-five years,
whose money has been dispersed, whose name has been
forgotten, of whom nothing remains on earth but the
few hours a day of time filched from him by Pugin.</p>
<p>Pugin had a hard and bitter fight for twenty years
before he obtained recognition. The garret and starvation
act had been unduly prolonged in the case of this
genius, and it seemed a mystery where and how in the
ruined city which is at the heart of every city, in that
<i>cour des Miracles</i> where the Bohemians camp, he had
found, like a crystal vase, his exquisite style, preserved
it unbroken by mischance or shock of fate, and carried
it safely at last to the hands of Fame.</p>
<p>He was very rich now, very powerful, and very fortunate.
Charitable, too, and ever ready to assist a fellow-worker
in straitened circumstances, and to-day as he sat
reading in the cool recesses of his library, and listening
to the sound of the Paris he loved floating in with the
warm June air through the open window, he felt at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
peace with all the world and in a mood to do justice to
his bitterest enemy.</p>
<p>The striped sun-blinds filtered the blaze outside, letting
pass only a diffused and honey-coloured twilight;
a great bowl of roses filled the room with the simple and
deep poetry of summer, the story of the hedges and the
fields, of orchards shot through with the voices of birds,
of cattle knee-deep in cool water where the dragon-flies
keep up their eternal dance to the flute-like ripple of the
river amidst the reeds.</p>
<p>Pugin, his book upon his knees, was enjoying these
pictures of summer woven by perfume, when a servant
entered and handed him Adams&#8217;s card and the letter of
introduction written by Sabatier.</p>
<p>He ordered the visitor to be shown in. Adams, when
he entered, found himself before a small man with a
big head; an ugly little man, with a look of kindness
and a very gracious and charming manner.</p>
<p>To Pugin Adams seemed a giant. A giant bronzed
by unknown suns, talking French indifferently well,
and with a foreign accent. An interesting person, indeed,
but a being quite beyond his range of knowledge.</p>
<p>Pugin, in physical matters, was timid as a rabbit.
He had never travelled farther than Trouville or Ostend,
and when he indicated a chair, and when these two sat
down to talk to each other, the mastiff-man felt instinctively
the presence of the rabbit-man, and was at a loss
how to begin.</p>
<p>Not for long, though. Bluffly, and with little grace
enough, but with earnestness and a cunning one would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
never have suspected, he told of Maxine&#8217;s great admiration
for the author&#8217;s work, and how she had suggested
the enlistment of the said author in the crusade against
crime which he, Adams, was endeavouring to raise.</p>
<p>Pugin listened, making little bows, sniffing the lettuce
which the mastiff-man had so cunningly placed before
his nose.</p>
<p>Then honestly and plainly and well, Adams told his
tale, and the rabbit held up its hands in horror at the
black doings disclosed to it. But it was horror divorced
from sentiment. Pugin felt almost as great a revulsion
toward the negroes upon whom these things were done
as toward the doers.</p>
<p>He could not see the vast drama in its true proportions
and its poetical setting of forest, plain, and sky. The
outlandish names revolted him; he could not see Yandjali
and its heat-stricken palms or M&#8217;Bassa burning in
the sun.</p>
<p>But he listened politely and it was this that chilled the
heart of the story-teller who instinctively felt that though
he had shocked his hearer, he had not aroused that high
spirit of revolt against injustice which converts a man
into a living trumpet, a living axe, or a living sword.</p>
<p>Pugin would have been a great force could his sentiment
have been awakened; but he could not see palm trees.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you have? You cannot grow baobabs
on the Boulevards.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Ma foi!</i>&#8221; said he, &#8220;it is terrible what you tell me,
but what are we to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you might help,&#8221; said Adams.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I? With all the power possible and goodwill. It
is evident to me that should you wish for success in this
matter, you should found a society.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing done in a public way without coöperation.
You must found a society; you may use my
name. I will even let you put it on the committee list.
I will also subscribe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now Pugin was on the committee lists of half a dozen
charitable and humanitarian concerns. His secretary
had them all down in a book; but Pugin himself, lost in
his art and the work of his life, had forgotten their very
names. So would it be with this.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said the visitor.</p>
<p>Pugin would lend his purse to the cause, and his name,
but he would not lend his pen&mdash;simply because he could
not. To every literary man there are dead subjects;
this question was dead to the author of &#8220;Absolution&#8221;&mdash;as
uninspiring as cold mutton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Adams, and rose to take his leave.
His rough-hewn mind understood with marvellous perspicuity
Pugin&#8217;s position.</p>
<p>&#8220;And one moment,&#8221; cried the little man, after he had
bidden his visitor good-bye and the latter was leaving
the room. &#8220;One moment; why did I not think of it
before? You might go and see Ferminard.&#8221;</p>
<p>He ran to a desk in the corner of the room, took a visiting
card and scribbled Ferminard&#8217;s address upon it,
explaining as he wrote that Ferminard was the deputy
for &mdash;&mdash; in Provence; a Socialist it is true, but a terrible
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
man when roused; that the very name of injustice was
sufficient to bring this lion from his den.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell him Pugin said so,&#8221; cried he, following his
visitor this time out on the landing and patting him on
the shoulder in a fatherly manner, &#8220;and you will find
him in the Rue Auber, No. 14; it is all on the card; and
convey my kind regards to Mademoiselle &mdash;&mdash;, that
charming lady to whose appreciation of my poor work I
owe the pleasure of your visit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nice little man,&#8221; said Adams to himself as he walked
down the Boulevard Haussmann.</p>
<p>He found Ferminard at home, in an apartment smelling
of garlic and the south. Ferminard, a tall, black-bearded
creature, with a glittering eye; a brigand from
the Rhone Valley who had flung himself into the politics
of his country as a torpedo flings itself into the sea, greeted
Adams with effusion, when he read Pugin&#8217;s card; gave
him cigarettes, and shut the open window in honour of
his guest.</p>
<p>He worked himself into a state of indignation over
Adams&#8217;s story; as a matter of fact he knew the whole
thing well; but he was too polite to discount his
visitor&#8217;s grievance, besides it gave him an opportunity
to declaim&mdash;and of course the fact that a king was
at the bottom of it all, added keenness to the arrows
of his invective.</p>
<p>As Adams listened, delighted to have awakened such
a trumpet; as he listened to Ferminard thundering
against all that over there, speaking as though he were
addressing the Chambre, and as though he had known
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
Africa intimately from his childhood, he noticed gradually
and with alarm that the topic was changing; just
a moment ago it was Africa and its luckless niggers; the
Provençal imagination picturing them in glowing colours,
and the Provençal tongue rolling off their disabilities and
woes. One would have fancied from the fervour of the
man that is was Ferminard who had just returned from
the Congo, not Adams.</p>
<p>Well, a moment after, and Africa had quite fallen out
of the discussion. As a child lets a Noah&#8217;s Ark fall
from its hands&mdash;elephants, zebras and all on to the
floor whilst he grasps for a new toy&mdash;so Ferminard
let Africa tumble whilst he grasped for Socialism, found
it and swung it like a rattle, and Socialism went the way
of Africa as he seized at last that darling toy&mdash;himself.
The speech, in its relationship to the subject in point, was
the intellectual counterpart of the cry of those mechanical
pigs which the street venders blow up, and which,
standing on a board, scream in the face of Oxford Street,
loudly at first, and then, as the figure collapses, weakening
in voice to the buzzing of a fly.</p>
<p>Ferminard was, in fact, a great child with a good heart,
a Provençal imagination, a power of oratory, a quickness
in seizing upon little things and making them seem
great, coupled with a rather obscure understanding
as to the relative value of mountains and mole-hills.
A noise maker of a first-class description, but useless for
any serious work. <i>Feu de bruit</i> was his motto, and he
lived up to it.</p>
<p>It is only when you try to enlist men on your side
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
in some great and holy cause, that you come to some
knowledge of the general man&#8217;s weakness and want
of holiness&mdash;your own included. Adams, during the
fortnight that followed his visit to Pugin, had this fact
borne in on him. All the thinking minds of the centre of
civilization were so busy thinking thoughts of their
own making, that it was impossible to attract their attention
for more than a moment; from Bostoc the dramatist
to Bastiche the anarchist, each individual was turning
his own crank diligently, and not to be disturbed,
even by Papeete&#8217;s skull.</p>
<p>With such a thing in one&#8217;s hand, picked up like some
horrible talisman which, if not buried, will eventually
cast its spell upon human thought and the future of the
world; with such a thing in one&#8217;s hand, surely the
Church would present itself to the mind as a court of
appeal.</p>
<p>But as the Roman Catholic Church had actually put
its broad back against the door of the torture chamber,
and was, in fact, holding it tight shut whilst Papeete&#8217;s
head was being hacked from his body, it would scarcely
be logical to bring out the victim&#8217;s skull hoping for redress.
Other denominations being of such little power in
France, Adams determined to leave the attempt to
rouse them till he reached England, whither he determined
to go as soon as Berselius&#8217;s health would permit
him.</p>
<p>One evening, a fortnight after his visit to Pugin, on
his return to the Avenue Malakoff, Maxine met him
in the hall.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></p>
<p>He saw at once from her face that something had
happened.</p>
<p>Berselius was worse; that afternoon he had suddenly
developed acute neuralgia of the right side of the head,
and this had been followed almost immediately by
twitching and numbness of the left arm. Thénard
had been summoned and he had diagnosed pressure on
the brain, or, at least, irritation from depressed bone,
due to the accident.</p>
<p>He declared himself for operation, and he had gone
now to make arrangements for nurses and assistants.</p>
<p>&#8220;He will operate this evening,&#8221; said Maxine.</p>
<p>&#8220;And Madame Berselius?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have telegraphed for her.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLI</h2>
<h3>THE RETURN OF CAPTAIN BERSELIUS</h3>
</div>

<p>Berselius, for the last fortnight, had been
going back, slowly going from bad to worse,
and keeping the fact to himself.</p>
<p>Sulphonal, trional, morphia, each tried in turn had
no power to prevent him from dreaming. Sleep as
soundly as he would, just as he was awaking, the black
blanket of slumber, turned up at a corner or an edge by
some mysterious hand, would reveal a dream or part of one.</p>
<p>There was nothing in these dreams to terrify him
when he was dreaming them; in them, he was just the
old brave Berselius that nothing could terrify, but there
was often a good deal to terrify him when he awoke.</p>
<p>Many of them were quite innocent and as fatuous
as dreams are wont to be, but even these innocent dreams
fretted the soul of the waking man, for in every scrap
and vestige of them he recognized the mind of that other
personality.</p>
<p>After the first few days, his intellect, so severe and
logical, began to lose its severity and logic, and to take
up sides with his heart and to cry aloud against the
injustice of this persecution.</p>
<p>Why should he be haunted like this? He felt no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
trace of remorse now for the past; the sense of injustice
swallowed all that. Every day seemed to drive that past
further off, and to increase the sense of detachment
from that other man and his works; yet every night a
hand, like the hand of some remorseless chess player,
put things back in their places.</p>
<p>With the falling of the curtain of sleep he became
metamorphosed.</p>
<p>Then came the day when the evil he was suffering
from declared itself in a physical manner and Thénard
was called in.</p>
<p>Thénard found his patient in bed. His mind was
quite clear, but the pupils of his eyes were unequal;
there was numbness in the left arm and want of grip
in the hand. He had been prepared for the change
evident in Berselius&#8217;s face and manner, for Maxine had
told him in a few words of the accident and loss of memory,
and as he took his seat by the bedside he was about
to put some questions relative to the injury, when Berselius
forestalled him.</p>
<p>Berselius knew something about medicine. He
guessed the truth about his own case, and he gave a succinct
account of the accident and the loss of memory
following it.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is due to the result of the injury, is it not?&#8221; said
Berselius, pointing to his left arm when he had finished.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid so,&#8221; said TThénard, who knew his patient,
and that plain speaking would be best.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some pressure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I imagine.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t be afraid of speaking out. I don&#8217;t mind
the worst. Will an operation remove that pressure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If, as I imagine, there is some pressure from the
inner table of the skull on the brain, it will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now,&#8221; said Berselius, &#8220;I want you to listen
to me attentively; ever since that accident, or, at least,
since I regained memory, I have felt that I am not the
same man. Only in sleep do I become myself again&mdash;do
you understand me? I have quite different aims
and objects; my feelings about things are quite different;
my past before the accident is ruled off from my present&mdash;that
is, when I am awake.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I dream I become my old self again&mdash;is that
not strange?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Thénard, &#8220;every man is double. We
have numerous cases where, from accident or other
circumstances, a man&#8217;s personality changes; one side
of his nature is suppressed. There is one strange point
about your case, though, and that is the waking up of
the suppressed personality so vividly during sleep; but
in your case it is perhaps not so strange.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because, and excuse me for being personal even
though I am complimentary, your personality as I knew
you before your accident was so profound, and vivid,
and powerful, that even though it is suppressed it must
speak. And it speaks in dreams.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So!&mdash;perhaps you are right. Now tell me, if you operate
and remove the pressure, may I become myself again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Even after all this time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The mind,&#8221; said Thénard, &#8220;has nothing to do with
time. At the Battle of the Nile, a sea captain, one of
those iron-headed Englishmen, was struck on his iron
head with fragment of shell. He lost his memory.
Eight months after he was trephined; he awoke from
the operation completing the order he was giving to his
sailors when the accident cut him short&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would be the same man. I would not be tormented
with the other self which is me, now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly&mdash;I do not say probably, but possibly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Berselius, &#8220;for God&#8217;s sake, operate
at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to wait for another twelve hours,&#8221; said
Thénard, rising and re-examining the slight dent of his
patient&#8217;s skull.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, to see if things may be cleared up a bit, and
the necessity for operation be removed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Operate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, in every operation, however slight, there
is an element of danger to life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Life! what do I care? I insist on your operating.
Not another night shall pass&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As you will,&#8221; said Thénard.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said Berselius, &#8220;make your preparations,
and send me my secretary.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>At twelve o&#8217;clock that night, Maxine was seated
in the library, with a book which she had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
vainly trying to read face downward on the floor
beside her.</p>
<p>Thénard, his assistant surgeon, and two nurses, had
arrived shortly after ten. Operating table, instruments,
everything necessary had been brought, set up, and fixed
by Thénard&#8217;s own man.</p>
<p>Adams had no part in the proceedings except as a
looker-on. No man could assist Thénard in an operation
who was not broken to the job, for, when
operating Thénard became quite a different person
to the every-day Thénard of lecture room and hospital
ward.</p>
<p>That harsh voice which we noticed in him in the
first pages of this book when on entering the lecture
room of the Beaujon he could not find his coloured
chalks, came out during an operation, and he would
curse his assistant to the face for the slightest fault or
fancied fault, and he would speak to the nurses as no
Frenchman ever spoke to Frenchwoman unless with
deliberate intent to insult. When the last stitch was in,
all this changed; nurses and assistant forgot what had
been said, and in the ease of released tension, worshipped
more than ever the cadaverous genius who was now
unwinding from his head and mouth the antiseptic
gauze in which he always veiled them when operating.</p>
<p>The clock on the mantel pointed to a few minutes past
the hour, when the door opened, and Adams came in.</p>
<p>Maxine rose to meet him.</p>
<p>She read both good and bad news in his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;The operation has been successful, but there is great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
weakness.&#8221; He rolled an armchair for her to sit down,
and then he told her as much as she could understand.</p>
<p>Thénard had found a slight depression of the inner
table of the skull, and some congestion and thickening
of the dura mater. It all dated from the accident. There
would, without doubt, have been severe inflammation
of the brain, but for Berselius&#8217;s splendid condition at the
time of the accident, and the fact that Adams had bled
him within an hour of the injury. Thénard had relieved
the pressure by operation, but there was great weakness.</p>
<p>It was impossible to say what the result would be yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has he regained consciousness?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is just recovering from the anæsthetic.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl was silent for a moment, then she asked where
Thénard was.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has left. He has to operate again to-night on a
case which has just called for him by telephone. He
asked me to tell you that everything possible has been
done. He will call in the morning, and he has left everything
till then in my hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not go to bed,&#8221; said Maxine. &#8220;I could not
sleep, and should my father want to see me, I shall be
ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Adams, &#8220;perhaps it will be better so. I
will go up and stay with him, and I will call you if it is
necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>He left the room, and Maxine took up the book she
had dropped, but she could not read. Her eyes, travelling
about the room, rested here and there on the trophies
and the guns and the wild implements of destruction
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
collected by the hunter, who was now lying upstairs, like
a child dandled on the dark knees of death.</p>
<p>The books on philosophy, natural history, oceanography,
and history, in their narrow cases contrasted
strangely with the weapons of destruction and the relics
of the wild. The room was like a mirror of the mind
of Berselius, that strange mind in which the savage dwelt
with the civilized man, and the man of valour by the side
of the philosopher.</p>
<p>But the strangest contrast in the room was effected
by Maxine herself&mdash;the creation of Berselius&mdash;his
child, blossoming like a beautiful and fragile flower,
amidst the ruins of the things he had destroyed.</p>
<p>When, after daybreak, Adams came to find her, she
was asleep.</p>
<p>Berselius, awaking from a sleep that had followed
the effects of the anæsthetic, had asked for her.</p>
<p>Thénard had fixed upon the white marble bathroom
adjoining Berselius&#8217;s sleeping chamber as his operating
theatre, and after the operation the weakness of the
patient was so great, and the night so hot, they determined
to make up a bed for him there, as it was the
coolest room in the house.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful room. Walls, pillars, floor and ceiling,
of pure white Carrara marble, and in the floor, near
the window, a sunk bath, which, when not in use, was
covered by a grating of phosphor bronze, showing a
design of sea serpents and seaweed. There were no
basins or lavatory arrangements, nothing at all to break
the pure and simple charm of this ideal bathing-place
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
whose open French window showed, beyond a balcony
of marble, the tops of trees waving against the blue sky
of early morning.</p>
<p>Berselius was lying on the bed which had been arranged
for him near the door; his eyes were fixed on the waving
tree tops. He turned his head slightly when Maxine
entered, and looked at her long and deliberately.</p>
<p>In that one glance Maxine saw all. He was himself
again. The old, imperious expression had returned;
just a trace of the half-smile was visible about his lips.</p>
<p>The great weakness of the man, far from veiling the
returned personality, served as a background which made
it more visible. One could see the will dominating the
body, and the half-helpless hands lying on the coverlet
presented a striking contrast to the inextinguishable
fire of the eye.</p>
<p>Maxine sat down on the chair by the bed. She did
not attempt to stroke the hand near her, and she smothered
whatever emotion she felt, for she knew the man who
had returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your mother?&#8221; said Berselius, who had just sufficient
voice to convey interrogation as well as words.</p>
<p>&#8220;She has not returned yet; we telegraphed for her,
she will be here to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221;</p>
<p>The sick man turned his head again, and fixed his
eyes on the tree tops.</p>
<p>The hot, pure, morning air came through the open
window, bringing with it the chirruping and bickering
of sparrows; a day of splendour and great heat was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
breaking over Paris. Life and the joy of life filled the
world, the lovely world which men contrive to make so
terrible, so full of misery, so full of tears.</p>
<p>Suddenly Berselius turned his head, and his eyes found
Adams with a not unkindly gaze in them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, doctor,&#8221; he said, in a voice stronger than the
voice with which he had spoken to Maxine. &#8220;This is
the end of our hunting, it seems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adams, instead of replying, took the hand that was
lying on the coverlet, and Berselius returned the pressure,
and then relinquished his hold.</p>
<p>Just a handshake, yet it told Adams in some majestic
way, that the man on the bed knew that all was up with
him, and that this was good-bye.</p>
<p>Berselius then spoke for a while to Maxine on indifferent
things. He did not mention his wife&#8217;s name, and
he spoke in a cold and abstracted voice. He seemed to
Adams as though he were looking at death, perfectly
serenely, and with that level gaze which never in this
world had been lowered before man or brute.</p>
<p>Then he said he was tired, and wished to sleep.</p>
<p>Maxine rose, but the woman in her had to speak.
She took the hand on the coverlet, and Berselius, who was
just dozing off, started awake again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said he, as though he had forgotten something,
then he raised the little hand of Maxine and touched it
with his lips.</p>
<p>Then he asked that his wife should be sent to him
on her return.</p>
<p>Alone, he closed his eyes and one might have fancied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
that he slept, yet every now and then his eyelids would
lift, and his eyes, unveiled by drowsiness, would fix
themselves on some point in the room with the intent
gaze of a person who is listening; so in the forest, or
on the plain, or by the cane brake had he often listened
at night, motionless, gun in hand and deadly, for the
tiger or the water buck.</p>
<p>Half an hour passed and then from the adjoining
room came a footstep, the door opened gently, and Madame
Berselius entered. She was dressed just as she
had traveled from Vaux. She had only just arrived, to
find death in the house, and as she looked at the figure
on the bed she fancied she beheld it indeed.</p>
<p>Closing the door gently she approached the bed. No,
it was not death but sleep. He was breathing evenly
and rhythmically, sleeping, apparently, as peacefully
as a child.</p>
<p>She was about to turn away when, like a bather who
has ventured into some peaceful tropic rock pool wherein
lurks an octopus, she found herself seized and held.
Berselius&#8217;s eyes were open, he was not asleep. His gaze
was fixed on hers, and he held her with his eyes as the
cat holds the bird or the python the man.</p>
<p>He had been waiting for her with the patience and
the artfulness of the hunter, but no game had ever inspired
such ferocity in him as this woman, vile and little,
who yet had abased him to the earth.</p>
<p>He was dying, but what beast full of life is more dangerous
than the dying tiger?</p>
<p>As Berselius gazed at the woman, she, with all her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
will urging her body to retreat, approached him. Then,
her knees touching the bed, she fell on her knees beside
him and his hand fell on her shoulder.</p>
<p>Holding her thus, he gazed on her coldly, dispassionately,
and critically, as an emperor of old might have
gazed on a defaulting slave. Then, as though his anger
had turned to disgust, as though disdaining to waste a
word on her, he struck her full in the face with the
back of his right hand, a blow that caused her to cry
out and sent her groveling on the marble floor, where
a moment after the nurse on duty, attracted by the cry,
found her.</p>
<p>Berselius was dead, but the mocking smile on his lips
remained, almost justified by the words of the nurse
imploring the woman on the floor to calm herself and
restrain her grief.</p>
<p>Whatever his life may have been, his death affected
Adams strangely. The magnetism of the man&#8217;s character
had taken a strong hold upon him, fascinating him
with the fascination that strength alone can exercise.
And the man he regretted was not the ambiguous being,
the amended Berselius, so obviously a failure, but the
real Berselius who had returned to meet death.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLII</h2>
<h3>AMIDST THE LILIES</h3>
</div>

<p>One day in March, nine months later, at Champrosay,
in the garden of a little cottage near the
Paris road, Maxine Berselius stood directing
the movements of an old man in a blue blouse&mdash;Father
Champardy by name, and a gardener by profession.</p>
<p>On the death of her father, Maxine had come to an
arrangement with her mother, eminently suited to the
minds and tastes of both women.</p>
<p>Maxine absolutely refused to touch any part of the
colossal fortune left by her father. She knew how it
had been come by, and as she had a small fortune of her
own, a very small fortune of some ten thousand francs
a year settled on her by an uncle at her birth, she determined
to live on it, and go her own way in life.</p>
<p>Art was to her far preferable to society, and in a little
cottage with one woman for a servant, ten thousand
francs a year were affluence.</p>
<p>Madame Berselius, who had no scruple in using money
obtained in any way whatsoever, fell in with her daughter&#8217;s
views after a few formal objections.</p>
<p>Gillette had furnished the cottage as only a French
firm can furnish a cottage, and the garden, which had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
gone to decay, Maxine had furnished herself with the
help of Father Champardy.</p>
<p>Adams, after the death of Berselius, had lingered on
in Paris to settle up his affairs, going back to the Rue
Dijon and taking up his old life precisely at the point
where he had broken it off.</p>
<p>But he was richer by three things. Two days after
Berselius&#8217;s death, news came to him from America of the
death of an uncle whom he had never seen and the fact
that he had inherited his property. It was not very
much as money goes in America, but it was real estate
in New York City and would bring in some seven or eight
hundred pounds a year. He was richer by the experience
he had gained and the Humanity he had discovered in
himself, and he was richer by his love for Maxine.</p>
<p>But love itself was subordinate in the mind of Adams
to the burning question that lay at his heart. He had
put his hand to the plough, and he was not the man to
turn aside till the end of the furrow was reached. He
would have time to go to America, in any event, to look
after his property. He decided to stay some months in
England; to attack the British Lion in its stronghold;
to explain the infamies of the Congo, and then cross the
Atlantic and put the matter before the American Eagle.</p>
<p>He did.</p>
<p>For seven months he had been away, and every week he
had written to Maxine, saying little enough about the
progress of his work, and frequently using the cryptic
statement, &#8220;I will tell you everything when I come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>And &#8220;He will be back to-day,&#8221; murmured Maxine,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
as she stood in the little garden watching the old man at
his work.</p>
<p>The newness and the freshness of spring were in the
air, snow that had fallen three days ago was nearly gone,
just a trace of it lay on the black earth of the flower beds;
white crocuses, blue crocuses, snow-drops, those first
trumpeters of spring, blew valiantly in the little garden,
the air was sharp and clear, and the sky above blue and
sparkling. Great masses of white cloud filled the horizon,
sun-stricken, fair, and snow-bright, solid as mountains,
and like far-off mountains filled with the fascination and
the call of distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spring is here,&#8221; cried the birds from the new-budding
trees.</p>
<p>The blackbird in Dr. Pons&#8217;s garden to the left, answered
a rapturous thrush in the trees across the way, children&#8217;s
voices came from the Paris road and the sounds of wheels
and hoofs.</p>
<p>A sparrow with a long straw in its beak flew right
across Maxine&#8217;s garden, a little winged poem, a couplet
enclosing the whole story of spring.</p>
<p>Maxine smiled as it vanished, then she turned; the
garden gate had clicked its latch, and a big man was
coming up the path.</p>
<p>There was only Father Champardy to see; and as
his back was turned, he saw nothing and as he was deaf,
he heard nothing. The old man, bent and warped by
the years, deaf, and blind to the little love-scene behind
him, was, without knowing it, also a poem of spring; but
not so joyous as the poem of the sparrow.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And now tell me all,&#8221; said Maxine, as they sat in the
chintz-hung sitting room before a bright fire of logs.
They had finished their private affairs. The day was
two hours older, and a sunbeam that had pointed at them
through the diamond-paned window had travelled away
and vanished. The day was darker outside, and it was
as though spring had lost her sportive mood and then
withdrawn, not wishing to hear the tale that Adams
had to tell.</p>
<p>In Adams&#8217;s hand Papeete&#8217;s skull had been a talisman
of terrible and magical power, for with it he had touched
men, and the men touched had disclosed their worth
and their worthlessness. It had been a lamp which
showed him society as it is.</p>
<p>The life and death of Berselius had been an object
lesson for him, teaching vividly the fact that evil is indestructible;
that wash yourself with holy water or wash
yourself with soap, you will never wash away the evil
being that you have constructed by long years of evil-doing
and evil-thinking.</p>
<p>His pilgrimage in search of mercy and redress for a
miserable people had emphasized the fact.</p>
<p>The great crime of the Congo stood gigantic, like a
shadowy engine for the murdering of souls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Destroy that,&#8221; said the devil triumphantly. &#8220;You
cannot, for it is past destruction; it has passed into the
world of the ideal. No man&#8217;s hand may touch it; it is
beyond the reach like the real self of your friend Berselius.
Sweep the Congo State away to-morrow; this will remain.
A thing soul-destroying till the end of time. It began
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
small in the brain of one ruinous man, God whom I hate!
look at it now.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has slain ten million men and it will slay ten million
more, that is nothing; it has ruined body and soul, the
stokers who fed it and the engineers who worked it,
that is nothing; it has tangled in its wheels and debased
the consciences of five nations, that is nothing. It is
eternal&mdash;that is everything.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since I was flung out of heaven, I have made many
things, but this is my masterpiece. If I and all my works
were swept away, leaving only this thing, it would be
enough. In the fiftieth century it will still have its clutch
on man, yea, and to the very end of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cause and effect, my friend, in those two words you
have the genius of this machine which will exist forever
in the world of consequence, a world beyond divine or
human appeal.</p>
<p>In England, Adams had found himself confronted
with the dull lethargy of the people, and the indifference
of the Established Church. The two great divisions
of Christ&#8217;s Church were at the moment at death grapples
over the question of Education. Only amongst the
Noncomformists could be found any real response to the
question which was, and is, the test question which will
disclose, according to its answer, whether Christianity
is a living voice from on high, or an echo from the Pagan
past; and a debased echo at that. Debased, for if Adams
could have stood in the Agora of Athens and told his
tale of horror and truth, could Demosthenes have taken
up the story; could Leopold the Barbarian have been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
a king in those days, and have done in those days, under
the mandate of a deluded Greece, what he has done
under the mandate of a deluded England; what a living
spirit would have run through Athens like a torch, how
the phalanxes would have formed, and the beaked ships
at Piræus torn themselves from their moorings, to bring
to Athens in chains the ruffian who had murdered and
tortured in her name!</p>
<p>To complete the situation and give it a touch of hopelessness,
he found that others had striven well, yet almost
vainly in the field. Men working for truth and justice
as other men work for gold, had attacked the public
with solid battalions of facts, tabulated infamies; there
had been meetings, discussions, words, <i>palabres</i>, as they
say in the south; but the murderer had calmly gone
on with his work, and England had put out no hand
to stay him.</p>
<p>But it was not till he reached America, that Adams
found himself fighting the machine itself.</p>
<p>One great man with a living voice he found&mdash;Mark
Twain&mdash;and one great paper, at least. These had
raised their voices calling for Justice&mdash;with what result?</p>
<p>Two side facts the skull of Papeete showed to the
searcher, as a lamp shows up other things than the things
searched for. The deadness of the English Church to the
spiritual, and the corruption of his own countrymen.</p>
<p>When he had finished, it was dark outside. The
firelight lit up the little room. Glancing through the
diamond-paned window at that happy interior, one would
never have guessed that the man by the fire had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
telling the girl by his side not a love story, but the story of
the world&#8217;s greatest crime.</p>
<p>Maxine, whose hand was resting on the hand of her
companion, said nothing for a moment after he had
ceased speaking. Then, in a half-whisper, and leaning
her forehead on his hand, &#8220;Poor things,&#8221; sighed Maxine.</p>
<p>So attuned were her thoughts to the thoughts of her
companion, that she voiced the very words that were
in his mind, as gazing beyond his own happiness and a
thousand miles of sea and forest, he saw again the moonlight
on the mist of the Silent Pools, and the bleached and
miserable bones.</p>
